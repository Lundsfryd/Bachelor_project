Der manglede  politisk vilje og tro på, at vi kunne forny og udvikle det  danske samfund.       Tre stykker nyere historie. Tilsammen danner de afsæt  for nogle ganske afgørende beslutninger om Danmarks fremtid,  beslutninger, som vi skal træffe i løbet af denne samling.  Vælger vi rigtigt og vælger vi ansvarligt, holder vi fast i  vore egne samfundsværdier, så kan vi give Danmark den bedst  tænkelige start på det 21. århundrede.       Politik gør en forskel. På fire et halvt år er Danmark  som forvandlet. Danmark er nu i fremgang; vi har vist, at vi  godt kan. Vores vej - den danske vej - er ikke en kopi af  andres veje. Den er ikke kommet ved at efterligne eller ved  at ligge i læ af andre. Den er kommet, fordi vi ville det.  Den er kendt, og den er respekteret i udlandet.       Regeringen har fremlagt sin vision for Danmark år 2005.  Vi vil ruste Danmark og hver enkelt borger til at klare sig i  det nye århundrede.       Regeringen er fast besluttet på at fastholde  fremgangslinien for Danmark, ikke alene til gavn for dem, der  kan selv, ikke alene til gavn for de fleste, men til gavn for  alle, for hele den danske befolkning. For hvad hjælper vel  det, at vi sikrer overskuddet på betalingsbalancen, hvis der  er underskud på samhørighed og på fællesskabsfølelse.       For regeringen er der to overordnede beslutninger i  denne samling: for det første folkeafstemningen om  Amsterdamtraktaten, for det andet den nødvendige justering af  økonomien.       Sammen med disse to overordnede beslutninger vil  regeringen tage en række initiativer, og jeg vil i min  redegørelse i dag samle mig om fem hovedområder, der er helt  centrale for vores hverdag:       1. Kvalitet i den offentlige service.       2. Familiens trivsel og børnenes uddannelse.       3. Bedre miljø og sunde fødevarer.       4. Et dynamisk erhvervsliv og arbejdsmarked.       5. En konsekvent rets- og udlændingepolitik.  Og nu til de to overordnede beslutninger:       I det store internationale billede har vi i de senere år  vist, at et lille land - vort land - godt kan gøre sig  gældende. Det er et land, der gør en forskel.  Det har været et travlt år for Danmark i  udenrigspolitikken, et år med mange milepæle: topmøder i EU,  i OSCE og i NATO og besøg af USA's præsident. Det var et år,  hvor dansk udenrigspolitik høstede stor anerkendelse.  Også i kampen for menneskerettigheder vil Danmark  fortsat være i front; det har skabt stor respekt om Danmark i  verden. Her på fredag er der endnu et topmøde, vi skal  deltage i: Europarådets topmøde i Strasbourg om  menneskerettigheder.  FN's 52. generalforsamling afholdes i denne tid. Verden  har brug for et stærkt og effektivt FN. Det kræver reformer,  og det kræver økonomi. Danmark har givet FN's generalsekretær  sin helhjertede og fulde støtte.  Blandt FN's mange opgaver skal jeg nævne, at FN især bør  fortsætte sin aktive linie for rydning af antipersonelminer i  krigsplagede lande, så flygtninge kan vende hjem og nye  flygtningestrømme kan undgås.  Danmark har også været særdeles aktiv i udformningen af  en række initiativer, når det gælder internationale aftaler  om miljøet. Nu gælder det om på FN's globale klimamøde i  Kyoto at formindske den menneskeskabte drivhuseffekt og  forbedre klodens klima. Også her vil Danmark være én af  frontløberne.  Danmark har også været i front på den internationale  scene, når det gælder OSCE. Vi har i år haft formandskabet,  og vi har udfoldet et særdeles aktivt formandskab. OSCE har  bidraget afgørende til, at vi i Østeuropa nu kan holde en  række konflikter nede og forebygge andre. Albanien er jo det  gode eksempel.  NATO-topmødet i Madrid tidligere på året var et  historisk vendepunkt, et vendepunkt for organisationens  bidrag til sikring af freden i Europa. Et nyt fundament for  freden er skabt med beslutningen om NATO's udvidelse og den  historiske aftale mellem Rusland og NATO og mellem Ukraine og  NATO.       I Østersøområdet er det regeringens ambition at følge  op og at se en nordeuropæisk region blomstre i kultur,  samfundsmønster, beskæftigelse og økonomi. Regeringen vil  bruge sit formandskab for Østersørådet i år til at sætte  yderligere skub i samarbejdet.  Den største trussel mod freden i Europa er stadig  situationen i det tidligere Jugoslavien. Danske soldater gør  en stor og anerkendelsesværdig indsats. Hvis der bliver behov  for, at danske soldater bliver i Eksjugoslavien, også længere  end hidtil planlagt, så er regeringen positivt stemt herfor.  Og så til det europæiske spørgsmål. I det kommende  folketingsår skal vi ved en folkeafstemning træffe beslutning  om Danmarks placering i Europa. Vi, regeringen, har lært af  folkeafstemningen den 2. juni 1992, og vi har lært af  folkeafstemningen den 18. maj 1993. Vi har lært, og vi har  lyttet.  Danskerne vil godt være en del af Europa. Europa må også  godt være en del af Danmark, men også kun en del. For  regeringen var det derfor afgørende at nå et resultat i  Amsterdam, hvor den danske befolkning kunne genkende de  værdier, som samfundet i Danmark bygger på. Det lykkedes, det  lykkedes.  Der er derfor tre grunde til, at regeringen vil anbefale  den danske befolkning at stemme ja ved den kommende  folkeafstemning.  For det første: Amsterdamtraktaten er jo selve  forudsætningen, fundamentet for udvidelsen af EU til også at  omfatte landene i Øst- og Centraleuropa, ganske enkelt  forudsætningen for et fredeligt Europa, også for vore børn og  for vore børnebørn.  For det andet: Amsterdamtraktaten er ganske enkelt bedre  end den, vi har. Den er et klart fremskridt for de danske  mærkesager: demokrati, menneskerettigheder, bedre samarbejde  om miljø og beskæftigelse, mærkesager, som vi jo deler i  Folketinget og i samfundet.  For det tredje: De fire danske forbehold står intakte og  sikrede, som regeringen lovede den danske befolkning. Jeg  tror, at enhver kan erindre ordene »før, under og efter«.  Sådan forholder det sig.  Den ny traktat er jo at sammenligne med nye vedtægter  for en forening, men EU er ikke en forening, hvor vi skal  samarbejde om hvad som helst. Vi skal samarbejde om det  nødvendige. Vi skal samarbejde om lige præcis de spørgsmål,  som vi ikke kan løse hver for sig, hverken mere eller mindre.       I den ny traktat er der klare holdninger og klare mål.  Kampen mod arbejdsløsheden, ja, den er fortsat hvert enkelt  lands hovedansvar, men nu vil vi tage ved lære i fællesskab  af fortidens fejl. Vi vil undgå, at vi eksporterer  problemerne til hinanden i nedgangstider, og vi vil sikre, at  vi får mere beskæftigelse til gavn for os alle sammen i  opgangstider. På EU-topmødet i november tager vi fat i  praksis.  Vi ved jo også godt, at syreregnen ikke standser i  Padborg. Gamle atomkraftværker i Østeuropa er ikke alene  deres problem, men er jo i virkeligheden også vort problem.  Med de nye miljøbestemmelser i Amsterdamtraktaten kan vi  bedre bekæmpe den forurening, der kommer over grænserne, og  vi kan bedre sikre vores fælles miljø, for vores fælles miljø  er jo vores fælles ansvar.  Allervigtigst, allervigtigst for Danmark og for vores  fremtid og for de andre landes fremtid, allervigtigst er, at  Amsterdamtraktaten betyder, at vi nu kan gå i gang med at  begynde opbygningen af et helt, et udelt Europa.  Nu kan vi omsider give de øst- og centraleuropæiske  lande, herunder de tre baltiske lande, håndslag om et  kommende medlemskab. Ingen - og jeg gentager: ingen - skal  efterlades i usikkerhed. Vi skal på topmødet i december  træffe beslutning om, hvordan udvidelsesforhandlingerne skal  tilrettelægges. Der bliver ikke tale om en kvart udvidelse  eller en halv udvidelse. Der bliver tale om en hel  udvidelsesproces, om en sammenhængende proces, der vil  strække sig en hel del år ud i fremtiden.  Danmark er forrest, når det gælder miljøstøtten til  Østeuropa, herunder også til de baltiske lande. Vi er det  land, der bidrager mest, og resultaterne både for dem og for  os har været imponerende.  Ikke mindst i forbindelse med udvidelsen af EU er det  vigtigt, at ansøgerlandene lever op til miljøkravene, og det  vil Danmark hjælpe aktivt med til. Vi skal være med til at  sætte præg på udviklingen.  Nærhedsprincippet står nu tydeligere end før. Der er  trukket en klarere streg mellem vores egen selvbestemmelse og  det, vi ønsker EU skal samle sig om. EU's udvikling skal  fremover ske i en retning, som befolkningen føler sig tryg  ved, og hvor det er befolkningerne, der sætter tempoet.  Et ja ved den kommende folkeafstemning vil tegne et  perspektiv for Danmark i Europa. Et nej vil sætte Danmark på  sidelinjen, og det ønsker regeringen ikke. Dér hører Danmark  ikke hjemme! Regeringen fremsætter allerede i dag lovforslag  om Danmarks tilslutning til Amsterdamtraktaten, og  folkeafstemningen vil finde sted torsdag den 28. maj 1998.  Der bliver tid til en grundig debat, både her i Folketinget  og ikke mindst i befolkningen.  Så til den anden overordnede beslutning, regeringen  lægger op til, nemlig økonomien. Danmark er i fremgang, og  håbet og troen på fremgangen er genskabt. Vi har vist, at et  flittigt folk er at finde i Danmark, når bare det får  chancen, og danske virksomheder har vist, at de har talent og  styrke til at gribe de nye udfordringer.  Regeringen har gennem sin økonomiske politik - med bl.a.  reformerne af arbejdsmarkedet og skattesystemet - lagt nye,  bedre og mere stabile rammer til rette. Vi har fået en bedre  offentlig service med mindre tyngende offentlige udgifter, vi  har overskud på finanserne, renten og inflationen er  historisk lav, og der er overskud på betalingsbalancen. Men  det er ikke medvind udefra, der har bragt dansk økonomi i god  form. Vore største handelspartnere, Tyskland og Sverige,  halter bagud, og vi skal faktisk lede længe rundt i Europa  for at finde andre lande, hvor det går lige så godt som i  Danmark.  Mange steder her i landet er der en situation, hvor  praktisk talt alle er i arbejde, og måske allerbedst: De  unges arbejdsløshed er nedbragt med to tredjedele. Hver gang  der for 4 år siden var 3 unge arbejdsløse, er der i dag kun  én, og om få år får vi heldigvis svært ved at finde den ene.  Den nye generation så at sige suges ind i uddannelse og  arbejde, og dagens unge stilles over for muligheder, som vi  skal tilbage til 1960'erne og de tidlige 1970'ere for at  finde magen til.  Med et Danmark i fremgang kan vi se ind i en fremtid,  hvor langt færre er henvist til passiv forsørgelse, og hvor  alle, der kan arbejde, faktisk kommer i arbejde. Det er det  afgørende, for det er jo betingelsen for, at vi kan få kraft  til hurtigt at nedbringe den gamle gæld. Vi har en stærk  pligt til at sikre, at den nye generations fremtid ikke skal  tynges helt urimeligt af gamle ubetalte regninger. Både  pengegælden og miljøgælden skal ned, og regeringen vil  kompromisløst fastholde den kurs, folket og regeringen har  slidt så hårdt for sammen med et flertal i Folketinget, og  som har givet så gode resultater.  Men vil man holde retningen, skal man have en fast hånd  på rattet, og går det for hurtigt, må man lette foden lidt på  speederen. Det er derfor, regeringen i dag foreslår en  opstramning af finanspolitikken. Lige nu kører vi lidt for  hurtigt, og derfor vil vi - som vi hele tiden har sagt det -  ufortøvet justere den økonomiske politik, så vi holder ret  kurs og ret tempo. Vi må ikke, ja, vi vil ikke løbe selv den  mindste risiko for at ødelægge de gode tider, vi har fået  tilvejebragt i Danmark.  Vi må forebygge i stedet for at reparere, når skaden er  sket. Vi vil ikke have inflationsspøgelset manet frem igen.  Vi skal ikke skrue vort forbrug så hurtigt i vejret, at vi  mister overskuddet over for udlandet og dermed ikke kan få  udlandsgælden bragt ned, som vi har besluttet at gøre.  Vi vil ikke tøve med at gøre det rigtige, men vi vil  ikke bringe os i en situation, hvor vi bliver tvunget til at  udløse dramatiske indgreb som kartoffelkuren i sin tid. Vi  husker jo alt for godt, hvordan titusinder af arbejdspladser  gik tabt, og vi husker, hvordan mange familier oplevede, at  deres hus gik på tvangsauktion.  Vi har ikke brug for at bremse hårdt op. Der skal ikke  skæres i velstand og i velfærd, 1998 bliver stadig et endnu  bedre år end 1997, men tempoet i fremgangen skal være en  anelse mindre hektisk. Denne gang vil denne regering være på  forkant; den vil justere i tide, og den vil justere på en  socialt rimelig måde for at sikre beskæftigelsen også på  længere sigt.  Vi vil ikke angribe menneskers muligheder for at blive i  deres bolig eller købe sig en bolig; men stigningen i både  det private og det offentlige forbrug i Danmark må dæmpes  næste år. Vi ved jo godt, at privatforbruget er langt den  største post i familien Danmarks budget, og det stiger lidt  for meget i øjeblikket. Derfor er der brug for, at danskerne  sparer lidt mere op.  Regeringen vil derfor foreslå, at vi alle i 1998 lægger  1 pct. af lønnen til side til ekstra pensionsopsparing i  Arbejdsmarkedets Tillægspension. Det vil øge opsparingen med  4 mia. kr. For at dæmpe det lånefinansierede forbrug her og  nu foreslår regeringen desuden en midlertidig forhøjelse af  stempelafgiften på tillægslån i ejerboliger, og jeg vil gerne  understrege, at forhøjelsen ikke omfatter lån i forbindelse  med hussalg eller nybyggeri. Regeringen vil naturligvis også  på ny gennemgå statsbudgettet med tættekam. Her vil det være  vores mål at spare 2 mia. kr. ekstra, og endelig vil  regeringen foreslå opstramninger i arbejdsmarkedets  rådighedsregler samt en forenkling af voksen- og  efteruddannelsesområdet.  Forslagene tilsammen vil ikke ramme de ydelser, der  retter sig mod børnefamilier, pensionister og syge.  Regeringen vil afvise forslag om forringelser i kommunernes  økonomi, der bremser nødvendige forbedringer i sygehuse,  ældreomsorg, børnepasning og skole; men regeringen  forudsætter, at de kommunale udgifter næste år ikke udvikler  sig hurtigere, end det rent faktisk er aftalt i sommer.  Regeringens nye initiativer skal ses i tæt sammenhæng  med det allerede fremsatte forslag til finanslov for 1998.  For at opnå den nødvendige justering af den samlede økonomi  må også de budgetforbedringer, der er indarbejdet i  finanslovforslaget - herunder større arbejdsgiverforpligtelse  for sygedagpenge og justeringer af visse afgifter - indgå i  oplægget.  Jeg vil nu vende mig til regeringens initiativer på de  fem hovedområder, jeg omtalte indledningsvis.  For det første kvaliteten i den offentlige service:  »Danmark år 2005« er ikke en vision om at nedbryde  velfærdssamfundet og lade markedskræfterne klare det hele.  Det er tværtimod en vision om et dansk velfærdssamfund, der  bringes ind i det nye århundrede i en ny, strømlinet og  livskraftig udgave med endnu flere i arbejde, endnu færre på  overførsler og langt, langt mindre gæld.  De samlede offentlige udgifter tynger allerede nu langt  mindre i samfundets økonomi end for 4 år siden, især fordi  færre mennesker er henvist til at leve på  overførselsindkomst. De statslige driftsudgifter er ikke  vokset, og ved effektiv prioritering er der inden for  uændrede budgetter skabt plads til nye initiativer.  Langt de fleste offentligt ansatte findes ude i kommuner  og amter og gør et godt arbejde for at levere  velfærdssamfundets kerneydelser: vuggestuer, børnehaver,  folkeskole, gymnasier, hjemmehjælp, sygehuse, plejehjem osv.  Det er alt sammen områder, hvor danskerne har en berettiget  forventning om at få tilbudt service af ordentlig kvalitet.  Men alt for stramme budgetter i årene frem til 1993 førte til  åbenbare servicebrist og uacceptable ventetider. Vi husker jo  alle sammen avisoverskrifterne og tv-reportagerne om de  utilfredsstillende forhold dengang. Derfor har kommunerne og  amterne i forståelse og samarbejde med regeringen i de sidste  4 år brugt flere penge og ansat flere folk i et storstilet  forsøg på at komme problemerne til livs.  De sidste års udgiftsstigninger er imidlertid sket i et  tempo, der ikke kan fortsætte i de kommende år; det er der  enighed om mellem regeringen og de kommunale organisationer.  Men det er samtidig lige så klart, at der i årene frem til år  2005 vil være vigtige nye opgaver, der skal løses, og at der  skal gennemføres de nødvendige serviceforbedringer inden for  det offentlige. Derfor må vi overalt i det offentlige skærpe  vor opmærksomhed over for, om kræfterne og pengene nu bruges  på den rigtige måde: Er der stiv organisation? Er der  bureaukratisk tankegang? Så skal der råbes op! Det helt  overordnede hensyn må være, at borgerne altid får kvalitet,  får valuta for deres skattekroner; men det får de kun, når  medarbejdernes talenter bruges bedst muligt, og når  medarbejderne har inspirerende arbejdsvilkår.  Folketinget bør ikke blande sig i, hvordan kommunerne  løser deres opgaver. Folketinget bør alene fastholde, at det  er kommunernes folkevalgte, der har det politiske ansvar for  finansiering, for lige adgang, for kortere ventetid, for  kvalitet og for valgmuligheder. Det er dem, der må vurdere,  om private leverandører kan yde borgerne en bedre service,  end det kommunale system kan. Vi må lære af hinanden på  tværs, vi må lære af hinanden, også det offentlige og de  private imellem.  Men, men, men - selv med den mest vellykkede fornyelse  af den offentlige service - og vi lærer af hinanden - findes  der intet mirakel, der, som jeg har hørt det fremhævet fra  visse sider, på kort sigt kan fremtrylle nye tocifrede  milliardbeløb i besparelser. Der findes kun to måder: enten  ved voldsomme nedskæringer - og det ønsker regeringen ikke -  eller ved brugerbetaling på nøgleområder som sundhed,  uddannelse og ældreomsorg. Det ønsker regeringen heller ikke!  Sandheden skal frem: Løfter om store skattelettelser er  derfor enten en trussel om, at den private pengepung skal  betale for det, der i dag betales over skatter og afgifter,  eller også er det et katastrofalt bidrag til på ny at slå hul  på samfundets kasse.  Vore sygehuse skal fungere godt, og de skal fungere uden  lange ventetider. Amterne har i de sidste 4 år satset store  midler på at nærme sig dette mål. Meget er investeret i ny  teknik og moderne behandlingsmetoder, og samtidig er der  kommet bedre information og muligheder for at bestille »tid  til behandling«, det såkaldte bookingsystem. Vi ser nu de  begyndende resultater i form af kortere ventetider til  behandling og til operation.  Det frie sygehusvalg i det offentlige er så småt begyndt  at blive en realitet, og vi skal videre ad den vej, så de  mennesker, der ønsker hurtigere behandling, kan få det ved at  opsøge et andet sygehus, hvor ventetiden er kortere. Vi skal  ikke slappe af, før sygehusenes problemer er løst, og derfor  vil regeringen følge op på Sygehuskommissionens arbejde med  analyser af vore sygehuse som serviceenheder. Det vil  naturligvis ske i samarbejde med sygehusejerne. Er kvaliteten  og produktionen tilfredsstillende? Er det den rigtige  ledelsesmåde, vi anvender? Er samspillet mellem de enkelte  personalegrupper, som det skal være? Regeringen vil drøfte  resultaterne af en sådan analyse og mulige initiativer med  amterne, sygehusledelserne og personaleorganisationerne.  Når man bliver indlagt på et hospital, er man ofte bange  og bekymret, og man er selvsagt sårbar i sådanne situationer.  Men patienterne har også rettigheder, og derfor vil  regeringen fremsætte et samlet lovforslag, som bringer  klarhed, som samler, klargør og styrker patienternes  retsstilling på hospitalet. Det handler jo om selvværd, det  handler om respekt for den enkelte, og det handler om  kvalitet.       I politik plejer vi at tale om en række områder, og  desværre plejer vi også at anvende dette udtryk om mennesker  - i dette tilfælde mennesker, som kræver særlig opmærksomhed,  mennesker, som vi skylder at indfri løfterne til, mennesker,  som har sårede og sårbare sind.  Både omsorgen for de psykiatriske patienter, de fysiske  rammer på sygehusene og botilbudene har ikke været  tilstrækkelige. Nu er vi omsider efter års indsats begyndt at  komme på rette vej - igen som et resultat af et godt  samarbejde mellem stat, amter og kommuner. Ret vej er ikke  hele vejen. Retningen er sat, og vi skal fortsætte ad den vej  i årene, der kommer.  De ældre har krav på, at sundhedsvæsenet fungerer, og at  der er god forsyning af ældrevenlige boliger. Siden 1993 er  det samlede antal ældreboliger vokset. Vi har satset  målrettet netop på flere ældreboliger for at give vore ældre  mulighed for at opretholde en tilværelse, der ligger så tæt  som muligt op ad den tilværelse, de hidtil har kendt.  Men for at det skal lykkes, skal vore ældre også have  ordentlig hjælp i deres hjem til rengøring, til praktiske  gøremål og til mere personlige ting. Hjælpen skal være vel  tilrettelagt. Det er vigtigt, at det, der bliver lovet, også  bliver holdt. Men der er meget stor forskel på, hvor godt  hjemmehjælpen er organiseret ud over landet. Det kan de ældre  ikke være tjent med. Regeringen ser positivt på, at der  nu lokalt tilbydes de ældre valgmuligheder, når det gælder  praktisk hjælp i hjemmet.  Så til det andet store område: Familiens trivsel og  børnenes uddannelse. Familieliv og arbejdsliv skal hænge  bedre sammen. Det er godt for børnene, at deres forældre har  arbejde, men det forhold, at mange flere småbørnsforældre er  kommet i arbejde i de senere år, er en stor del af  forklaringen på den voldsomme vækst i efterspørgslen, vi har  set, efter offentlig børnepasning.  Der er i årene 1993-97 skaffet ekstra 130.000  børnepasningstilbud i danske kommuner. Kommunerne har faktisk  udrettet mere, end vi for fire år siden troede var nødvendigt  for fuld dækning af behovet, men der er endnu et stykke vej  til målet.  Vi ved også godt, at mange småbørnsfamilier har brug for  en mindre stresset hverdag. Regeringen vil derfor opfordre  arbejdsmarkedets parter til at drøfte en udvidelse af  adgangen til deltidsarbejde for ansatte med små børn.  Regeringen vil som bidrag til større ligestilling i  ansvaret for småbørnene komme med forslag om en to ugers  forlængelse af barselorloven for mænd. Regeringen vil med  arbejdsmarkedets parter drøfte mulighederne for en  smidiggørelse af børnepasningsorloven og drøfte en ændring af  funktionærloven, så gravide får adgang til fuld løn under  sygdom. På de statslige arbejdspladser vil der blive givet  tilbud om adgang til hjemmearbejdspladser.  Større hensyn til familiernes behov vil i sig selv  fremme ligestillingen mellem kvinder og mænd, og som led i  styrkelsen af ligestillingen vil regeringen også forslå at  ændre pensionslovgivningen, sådan at kvinder og mænd får  udbetalt den samme årlige pensionsydelse.  Børnene er nøglen til fremtiden. Skolen er nøglen til  børnenes fremtid. Vores fremtid afgøres derfor i høj grad af,  hvordan skolen er nu. Regeringen har - inden for de gode  rammer, folkeskolen angiver - igangsat en lang række  initiativer og forsøg med at gøre tingene anderledes, end vi  plejer. Lærere, forældre, kommuner, politikere - alle har vi  et ansvar for kvaliteten i folkeskolen; alle er vi optaget  af, at børnene lærer at læse, lærer at skrive, lærer at  regne, og at de lærer at bruge en computer.  Vi kan ikke være bekendt at give vore børn mindre end  det bedste. Vi skal ruste dem alle til at uddanne sig videre,  og vi er på rette vej. For aldrig før har en så stor del af  en ungdomsårgang været i gang med en uddannelse. Der er skabt  flere pladser på gymnasier, på erhvervsskoler, på  universiteter og på læreanstalter. Otte ud af ti er nu i  gang. I år 2000 er det vores mål, at det er ni ud af ti.  Regeringens mål er et tilbud om en god ungdomsuddannelse  til alle, uanset om man nu vælger fagligt, teoretisk eller en  kombination deraf. Vi vil inspirere til, at flere vælger en  faglig uddannelse; ellers bliver der jo mangel på håndværkere  på fremtidens arbejdsmarked.  Regeringen vil i efteråret indlede trepartsdrøftelser  med arbejdsmarkedets parter. Vi forventer, at parterne også  ved forårets overenskomstforhandlinger vil vise ansvarlighed,  som de har gjort det hidtil, så vi kan fastholde moderate  omkostningsstigninger og skabe flest mulige nye ekstra job.  Vi skal drøfte, hvordan vi i fællesskab kan fremme  udviklingen af et rummeligt arbejdsmarked, hvor mennesker med  nedsat arbejdsevne kan fastholde eller genvinde  beskæftigelsen. Vi skal give plads for dem, der endnu ikke  har fået en chance.  Det handler om, at virksomhederne i højere grad skal  påtage sig et socialt ansvar. Det handler også om »projekt  arbejdspladsfastholdelse«, som er vigtigt som initiativ, og  vi har allerede gode erfaringer hermed. Fleksjobbene skal  udbredes som et positivt alternativ til, at alt for mange  henvises til førtidspension.  Så skal vi også enes om en aktiv seniorpolitik, vi skal  tilskynde til et senere og mere gradvist  tilbagetrækningsmønster. Og heldigvis får arbejdspladserne jo  også i stigende grad brug for at bevare de ældres erfaringer.  Derfor skal vore ældre have reelle muligheder for at gå ned i  arbejdstid frem for helt at trække sig tilbage fra  arbejdsmarkedet.  Men et langt og et godt arbejdsliv bliver jo altså kun  en virkelig realitet med et ordentligt arbejdsmiljø.  Arbejdsmiljøet er stadig væk ikke godt nok. Der sker fortsat  nedslidning og alt, alt for mange ulykker på danske  arbejdspladser. Jeg vil meget indtrængende opfordre danske  virksomheder og arbejdsmarkedets parter til at prioritere  arbejdsmiljøindsatsen meget højere. Vi skal også være  foregangsland på dette område.       I sidste folketingssamling fik regeringen vedtaget de  lovforslag, der udmønter dele af handlingsprogrammet »Rent  arbejdsmiljø år 2005«. Den indsats vil blive forstærket nu.  Der indføres en belønningsordning for virksomheder, der gør  en særlig ekstraindsats ud over det, loven stiller krav om,  for at forbedre arbejdsmiljøet.  Regeringen vil også fortsætte sin offensive  miljøpolitik. Det er vores næste store felt. Vi har alle et  ansvar for, at vi ikke videregiver en negativ miljøarv til  vore børn og vore børnebørn. Beskyttelsen af vandmiljøet og  grundvandet skal være bedre. Vi vil ikke acceptere, at  drikkevandet forurenes og vore fjorde dør af iltsvind.  Reguleringen af landbrugets brug af gødning har ikke været  god nok. Der skal ske en bedre udnyttelse af husdyrgødningen,  og naturgenopretningen skal forstærkes.  Regeringen vil i dette folketingsår fremsætte forslag om  indførelse af en kvælstofafgift. Der er gjort meget, men der  er ikke gjort nok. Regeringen har de to sidste år forbudt 170  af de mest miljøbelastende pesticider, men vi har ikke nået  målene i pesticidhandlingsplanen. Der er derfor behov for at  stramme op. Regeringen vil fremsætte lovforslag om en mærkbar  forhøjelse af pesticidafgiften.  Bæredygtigt landbrug, rent vand og sunde fødevarer er  tre sider af samme sag. Danmark skal være foran med  kvalitetskravene. Regeringen vil i denne samling lægge  fundamentet for en ny og forenklet fødevarelovgivning. Det  skal styrke kvalitetsarbejdet, og det skal skabe  gennemsigtighed i produktionen.  Forbrugerne skal kunne stole på, at de fødevarer, de  køber, er sunde og rene. Vi vil ikke acceptere  sygdomsfremkaldende bakterier i vores mad. Kvaliteten af vore  fødevarer afhænger også af dyrenes adfærd og velfærd.  Forbruget af medicin skal reduceres. Regeringen vil skærpe  kontrollen med forbruget af veterinær medicin.  Ser vi på vores erhvervsliv og vores arbejdsmarked, kan  vi jo se et arbejdsmarked i Danmark, der fungerer langt mere  smidigt end andre steder i Europa og meget bedre end for få  år siden. Det er en meget væsentlig del af baggrunden for en  enestående stærk fremgang i dansk beskæftigelse - en  fremgang, vi hidtil har kunnet forene med lav inflation.  Vi har bevaret - og vi vil bevare - et godt  dagpengesystem, som ikke bare giver lønmodtagerne økonomisk  tryghed under ledighed, men også, og det skal man huske,  fritager virksomhederne for omkostninger ved lange  opsigelsesvarsler, som vi kender det i andre lande.  Arbejdsmarkedsreformerne har givet mennesker tryghed og  styrke i forandringen med klare rettigheder og pligter for de  ledige til at komme i gang igen.  Vi har massivt øget indsatsen for efteruddannelse og  igangsætning af de ledige. Ungeindsatsen har været en entydig  succes. Indsatsen over for de langtidsledige er blevet stadig  mere ambitiøs og med resultater. Kortvarig og ofte  perspektivløs jobtræning erstattes nu mere og mere af  uddannelse og af puljejob, der har perspektiv både for den  enkelte og for samfundet. Et enkelt eksempel er den indsats,  der nu er gået i gang, med at sørge for medarbejdere, der kan  hjælpe med overvågning på stationer og i S-tog.  Med den nye og langt bedre beskæftigelse i vort samfund  er der brug for, at den enkelte er parat til at bevæge sig,  tage nye udfordringer op, flytte branche, køre eller flytte  lidt længere efter nye jobmuligheder. Og med Danmark i  fremgang oplever vi stadig mangel på bestemte kvalifikationer  nogle steder, samtidig med at der er høj ledighed andre  steder.  Regeringen vil derfor foreslå, at ledige fremover efter  seks måneder kan anvises og skal søge et rimeligt arbejde  også uden for deres hidtidige fagområde.  Regeringen foreslår også justeringer i reglerne om  geografisk mobilitet, flyttehjælp, dimittender og aktivering.  Etableringsydelsen skal afskaffes, og endelig vil vi sikre,  at lediges brug af uddannelsesorlov i højere grad kobles til  en handlingsplan, der styrker deres muligheder for at komme i  ny beskæftigelse igen.  Regeringen ønsker, at efteruddannelsesmulighederne så på  den anden side forenkles og udnyttes endnu bedre. Derfor  foreslår vi, at brugerbetalingen på faglige efteruddannelser,  AMU-kurser, skal afskaffes.  Vi vil opfordre arbejdsgiverne til at tænke mere  langsigtet og tænke mere offensivt og derfor bruge  uddannelsesorloven langt mere til at opkvalificere deres egne  medarbejdere.  Dansk erhvervsliv har jo i de seneste år haft stærk  fremgang. Næsten 100.000 flere medarbejdere, stærkt  forbedrede overskud, rekordhøje aktiekurser og et rekordlavt  antal konkurser er det synlige resultat.  Fremgangen er udtryk for god og fremsynet ledelse i  vældig, vældig mange virksomheder. Men fremgangen er også et  produkt af en økonomisk politik, der har understøttet  erhvervenes behov for god markedsudvikling, rolig  lønudvikling, lav rente, veluddannede medarbejdere, et godt  forskningsmiljø, en aktiv erhvervspolitik og god udbygning af  infrastrukturen.  Derfor har regeringen besluttet gennem de seneste år at  iværksætte en række initiativer til at mindske de  administrative byrder for virksomhederne. Især mindre  virksomheder har jo fået afskaffet en lang række gebyrer og  afgifter.  Nu iværksætter regeringen et nyt projekt, der inden  udgangen af 1998 vil sikre, at virksomhederne kan overgå til  elektronisk indberetning af års- og skatteregnskaber og andre  statistiske oplysninger, og samtidig vil regeringen give  mindre virksomheder en betydelig administrativ aflastning: et  tilbud om at etablere let og billig adgang til at overdrage  administrative opgaver til særlige servicevirksomheder.  Vi vil styrke samarbejdet mellem virksomheder og  forskningsinstitutioner, ikke mindst for at styrke Danmarks  placering på informationsteknologiområdet, og vi vil forøge  indsatsen på de videregående IT-uddannelser i samarbejde med  erhvervene.  Ser vi på vores rets- og udlændingepolitik, har borgerne  krav på effektiv retshåndhævelse. Samfundet skal derfor  rustes tilstrækkeligt til en effektiv indsats, hvad enten det  gælder rockere, narko, gadebander, grov vold, simpelt tyveri,  selskabstømning, bagmandsvirksomhed eller miljøforbrydelser.  Politiet skal have styrke og teknologi til synligt og  effektivt at bidrage til borgernes tryghed og kriminalitetens  bekæmpelse. Hvor der er stigende problemer, skal der også  være en ekstra politiindsats og en hurtig strafforfølgning.  Siden flerårsaftalen fra 1995 har politiet fået  uforudsete og arbejdskrævende ekstra opgaver. Regeringen vil  derfor invitere forligspartierne til en forhandling om  justering af politiaftalen.  Regeringen vil samtidig tage initiativ til den fornødne  udbygning af fængslerne, så de »negativt stærke fanger« kan  isoleres på betryggende måde.  Domstolenes uafhængighed og særlige stilling skal  styrkes. Forslaget til en omfattende domstolsreform vil  derfor blive genfremsat allerede i næste uge. Det gælder også  regeringens forslag om større åbenhed omkring dommernes  bijob.  Justitsministeren vil afgive en redegørelse til  Folketinget om reduktion af ventetider inden for  retssystemet.  Så er der offentlighedsprincippet, som desværre i nogle  situationer er blevet misbrugt - misbrugt til at forfølge og  chikanere offentligt ansatte.  Regeringen vil fremsætte lovforslag, der begrænser  aktindsigten i personalesager for at skabe større  retssikkerhed for de ansatte, og det gælder for offentligt  som for privat ansatte. Fordi man er offentligt ansat, skal  man ikke være offentligt udhængt.  Regeringen vil fastholde en flygtningepolitik, der  bygger på både humanisme og konsekvens. Vi skal helt i  overensstemmelse med vore internationale pligter tage imod  dem, der kommer hertil på flugt fra borgerkrig og forfølgelse  i deres eget land, men jo mere vi kan give en håndsrækning  til fred og fremgang i deres eget hjemland, og jo mere vi kan  bane dem vejen for i sikkerhed at kunne vende tilbage, desto  flere kan vi hjælpe på bedste vis.  Vi skal med endnu større effektivitet bekæmpe  menneskesmugling og forhindre illegal indvandring fra sikre  lande, og til dem, der får lovligt ophold her i landet, skal  vi i deres egen interesse, i vores fælles interesse, stille  større krav.  Lad os sige det, som det er: Den hidtidige integration  af udlændinge har ikke været god nok. Der har i alt for høj  grad været tale om klientgørelse og passiv forsørgelse.  Regeringen vil fremsætte forslag til en helt ny  integrationslov, der både omfatter flygtninge og nye  familiesammenførte indvandrere. Sigtet er, at de nyankomne  får ret og pligt til at finde en plads på arbejdsmarkedet og  klare sig selv. Der skal bruges flere penge på at få  flygtninge og indvandrere i arbejde og færre på underhold.  Vi overvejer at gøre permanent opholdstilladelse til  noget, der ikke gives automatisk efter 3 år, men noget, man  skal kvalificere sig til gennem en målrettet indsats: ved at  integrere sig i det danske samfund, ved at lære sproget, ved  at undgå at stifte større gæld til det offentlige og undgå  kriminalitet.  Det enkelte menneske, den enkelte udlænding vil opleve,  at der stilles krav i Danmark, men man vil også opleve, at  det skaber forudsætningen for et langt mere positivt syn på  de udlændinge, der får permanent opholdstilladelse i Danmark.  Alt dette skal naturligvis ske med fuld respekt for  personlige, kulturelle og religiøse forskelle.  Ret og pligt i udlændingepolitikken betyder også, at vi  skal bekæmpe den modvilje, der møder indvandrere på det  danske arbejdsmarked. Fordi man har et fremmed navn, behøver  man ikke at have svært ved at få arbejde.  Regeringen har taget initiativ til, at statens  arbejdspladser lever op til deres ansvar, men det er  naturligvis helt afgørende, at også de private virksomheder  og kommunerne udviser fantasi, åbenhed og tolerance over for  folk med anderledes baggrund og et anderledes navn.  Rigsfællesskabet: Regeringen lægger vægt på et nært og  et tillidsfuldt samarbejde mellem alle dele af  rigsfællesskabet. Vi glæder os over, den færøske økonomi  gennem de seneste par år har gennemgået en på flere punkter  meget positiv udvikling. Indkomsterne har været stigende,  arbejdsløsheden har været faldende, og som noget meget, meget  vigtigt for Færøerne er udvandringen vendt, og landskassen  havde i 1996 overskud. Der budgetteres nu også med overskud i  1997 og i 1998.  Regeringen glæder sig over den positive udvikling, som  vi håber vi kan videreføre i årene fremover.  Regeringen ønsker det nytiltrådte grønlandske landsstyre  held og lykke med det forestående arbejde. Grønland har i de  seneste år været præget at stor økonomisk stabilitet trods en  betydelig følsomhed over for ændringer i fiskeriet.  Råstofforvaltningen skal efter aftale mellem regeringen  og landsstyret overdrages til Grønlands hjemmestyre - en  historisk aftale. Administrationen flyttes til Nuuk under  landsstyrets ansvar. Regeringen håber, at der fremover vil  vise sig store muligheder på råstofområdet til gavn for  beskæftigelsen og til gavn for indkomsterne for Grønland og i  Grønland.  Vi ved helt sikkert, at store forandringer sker i vort  samfund, men vi ved også, at fremskridt forstået som  forandring til noget bedre er noget, vi selv skal kæmpe for.  Hvis vi som ansvarlige politikere skal bevare befolkningens  tillid, skal vi vise vilje til at finde nye og bedre svar.  Jeg har redegjort for vores visioner i dag, for vores  mål for Danmark år 2005 og for den kurs, regeringen vil  insistere på for at nå disse mål.  Vi har talt om fem plus to vigtige områder for vores  fælles fremtid. To overordnede, en europæisk og en økonomisk  dansk, og fem hovedområder, der betyder så meget for  danskeres hverdag.  Vi har talt om, hvorfor vi skal sætte farten en anelse  ned for at nå sikkert videre frem til vort mål. Det er  afgørende for regeringen, at vi fastholder helheden og det  rigtige tempo i de nødvendige beslutninger. Viljen til at  gøre det nødvendige er jo også politik.  Regeringen vil ikke lade sig lamme af taktiske manøvrer  og uansvarlige meldinger fra anden side, for  handlingslammelse får jo bare små problemer til at vokse sig  store og alvorlige problemer til at forblive uløste. I en  situation, hvor der er behov for en vis justering i  forbruget, nytter det ikke at komme med store løfter om  skattelettelser, som der ikke er dækning for, eller med  forslag om ensidige nedskæringer over for samfundets dårligst  stillede, bl.a. dem på pension, efterløn eller dagpenge. Den  økonomiske udfordring, vi nu står over for, må ikke misbruges  til ideologiske skoleridt. Der er en opgave, og den skal  løses ordentligt og med fornuft, så de sidste 5 års  fremgangslinje kan fortsætte.  Befolkningen har betroet os, Folketing og regering, et  meget stort ansvar. Lad os nu ikke svigte dette ansvar.  Regeringen har som mindretalsregering opnået alle sine  resultater i samarbejde med andre. Det er vi os meget  bevidst, for samarbejdslinjen er jo den danske vej, og hvis  målene skal nås, skal der samarbejdes mellem partier i  Folketinget, mellem regering og kommuner og mellem  virksomheder og samfund.  Danmark er i fremgang. Det skal vi fastholde.  Må jeg foreslå, at vi indleder Folketingets arbejde med  at udbringe et leve for Danmark.      Danmark leve!      (Statsministerens opfordring besvaredes med et trefoldigt  hurra).      (Statsministerens redegørelse i henhold til grundlovens § 38   (skriftlig del)      I denne skriftlige del af redegørelsen gives en kortfattet  omtale af de lovforslag og forslag til folketingsbeslutning,  som regeringen ved begyndelsen af det nye folketingsår  forventer at fremsætte i løbet af folketingsåret. Denne del  af åbningsredegørelsen indeholder endvidere oplysninger om  ministerredegørelser til Folketinget.  De med (X) markerede lov- og beslutningsforslag  forventes fremsat inden den 15. november 1997.      ARBEJDSMINISTEREN      Ændring af lov om arbejdsløshedsforsikring  (X)      Lovforslaget fremsættes med henblik på at ændre reglerne om  indbetaling af medlemsbidrag m.v. samt tilsyns- og eventuelt  klagereglerne. Forslaget er bl.a. en opfølgning på  folketingsbeslutning af 15. maj 1997 (B 82) om øget  gennemskuelighed af arbejdsløshedskassernes  administrationsomkostninger.      Ændring af lov om seniorydelse  (X)      Lovforslaget omfatter konsekvensrettelser som følge af, at  50/50-stillinger efter bistandslovens §§ 91-95 ændres til  fleksjob med henholdsvis 1/3, ½ eller 2/3 løntilskud.      Lov om støtte til handicappede i erhverv      Forslaget skal bl.a. ses som et led i indsatsen for at skabe  et rummeligt arbejdsmarked. Loven samler de gældende regler  for støtte til handicappede inden for Arbejdsministeriets  område, bl.a. reglerne om personlig assistance til  handicappede i erhverv, handicappede ansøgeres fortrinsadgang  ved ansættelse hos offentlige arbejdsgivere, bevilling til  stadepladser og taxikørsel. Der forventes også fastsat regler  om arbejdspladsindretning samt eventuelt andre regler, der  tager sigte på at få handicappede i ordinær beskæftigelse  eller i skånejob/fleksjob.      Ændring af lov om arbejdsmiljø (Belønningsordning m.v.)  (X)      Formålet med forslaget er at gennemføre ændringer af  arbejdsmiljøloven i forbindelse med indførelse af en  belønningsordning for virksomheder, der gør en særlig indsats  for at forbedre arbejdsmiljøet. Med forslaget sikres  endvidere et uændret provenu til Arbejdsmiljørådets og  branchemiljørådenes indsats i forbindelse med gennemførelsen  af EU's 3. skadesforsikringsdirektiv. Lovforslaget skal ses i  sammenhæng med socialministerens forslag om ændring af lov om  forsikring mod følger af arbejdsskade og lov om  forsikringsvirksomhed og forventes fremsat samtidig hermed.      Ændring af lov om aktiv arbejdsmarkedspolitik, lov om  arbejdsløshedsforsikring m.v., lov om orlov, lov om  arbejdsmarkedsuddannelser og lov om kommunal aktivering  (X)      Der gennemføres en række arbejdsmarkedspolitiske initiativer,  der øger mobiliteten og fleksibiliteten på arbejdsmarkedet.  Som led i ændringerne sker der bl.a. en skærpelse af kravene  til de lediges faglige og geografiske mobilitet, ligesom  opmærksomheden om arbejdsmarkedsrelevansen af de lediges  uddannelsesforløb øges. Desuden afskaffes etablerings- og  igangsætningsydelsesordningerne.      Ændring af lov om ATP og personskatteloven  (X)      Der opkræves i 1998 et ekstraordinært bidrag til ATP-fonden  på 1 pct. Bidraget fastsættes på grundlag af lønsum og  eksisterende egenbidrag. Ændringen i personskatteloven  sikrer, at bidraget er fradragsberettiget i den almindelige  skattepligtige indkomst på linje med ordinære pensionsbidrag.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af lov om arbejdsløshedsforsikring m.v.      Forslaget vedrører opfølgning på seniorpolitiske initiativer,  herunder eventuel opfølgning på anbefalinger fra  Seniorpolitisk Initiativudvalg.      Ændring af lov om retsforholdet mellem arbejdsgivere og  funktionærer      Såfremt en kvindelig funktionær bliver uarbejdsdygtig som  følge af graviditet, skal arbejdsgiveren betale hende halv  løn i indtil 5 måneder. Tilsvarende gælder, såfremt  arbejdsgiveren ikke mener at kunne beskæftige hende, uanset  at funktionæren ikke er uarbejdsdygtig. Da dette frembyder et  ligestillingsmæssigt problem, overvejes det at foreslå  ændringer af loven. Dette vil i givet fald kunne ske i  forbindelse med en almindelig revision af funktionærloven,  som på en række punkter må anses for forældet.      Arbejdsministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Redegørelse om flaskehalsindsatsen      BOLIGMINISTEREN      Lov om leje af almene boliger  (X)      Bl.a. på baggrund af Lejelovskommissionens betænkning nr.  1331 sker der en opdeling af den gældende lejelovgivning i  tre selvstændige love: lov om leje af almene boliger, lov om  leje af erhvervslokaler m.v. og lov om leje af private  udlejningsboliger.       Den nye lov om leje af almene boliger indeholder en  række bestemmelser overført fra lov om leje og lov om almene  boliger m.v. Der fastsættes endvidere nye bestemmelser om  beboerklagenævn for det almene byggeri.       En samlet lejelov for det almene byggeri og de nye  beboerklagenævn vil indebære en væsentlig styrkelse af  retssikkerheden for den enkelte boligtager i det almene  byggeri.      Lov om leje af erhvervslokaler m.v.      Som opfølgning af Lejelovskommissionens betænkning, jf.  ovenfor, vil der blive fremsat lovforslag, der dels tager  udgangspunkt i aftalefrihed for parterne, men med beskyttelse  af lejerne i opsigelsessituationer, dels indeholder  eventuelle overgangsordninger for eksisterende lejeaftaler.       Forslaget vil betyde en forenkling af regelsættet for  udlejning af erhvervslejemål, ligesom det vil fjerne regler,  der hidtil har skabt usikkerhed for investorer i  erhvervsejendomme. Forslaget forventes også at ville give en  bedre og hurtigere tilpasning af lejen og øvrige  kontraktsvilkår til markedsforholdene.      Lov om leje af private udlejningsboliger      Forslaget indebærer en modernisering af lovgivningen bl.a. på  baggrund af anbefalingerne i Lejelovskommissionens  betænkning, jf. ovenfor. Lovgivningen forenkles bl.a. med  henblik på at gøre reglerne mere brugervenlige, og der  etableres huslejenævn over hele landet, eventuelt som  fælleskommunale nævn. Beboerindflydelsen styrkes bl.a. ved,  at der gives beboerne indflydelse på vedligeholdelsen og  forbedringen af ejendommene. Der søges også skabt bedre  incitamenter for udlejerne til at gennemføre forbedring og  vedligeholdelse af ejendommene.      Lov om offentlig regulering af boligforhold m.v.      Som følge af opdelingen af den gældende lejelovgivning i tre  selvstændige love er der behov for at udskille og samle de  dele af den gældende lovgivning, som vedrører den offentlige  regulering, i én særskilt ny lov.      Ændring af lov om almene boliger m.v.  (X)      Lovforslaget indebærer, at finansierings- og styringsreglerne  for det støttede byggeri ændres som følge af aftalen om  kommunernes økonomi for 1998. Det vil endvidere bl.a. blive  foreslået, at ordningen om tilskud til ansættelse af  beboerrådgivere videreføres i perioden 1998-2002, og at  statens samtykke altid skal indhentes, forinden der foretages  nedrivning af almene boligejendomme. Der foreslås endelig  ændringer vedrørende det statslige administrationsgebyr for  nyt alment boligbyggeri. De ændrede finansierings- og  styringsregler indebærer endvidere ændringer i  byfornyelseslovgivningen.      Ændring af lov om boligbyggeri  (X)      Forslaget betyder, at rammebeløbet for støttet boligbyggeri  afskaffes som led i aftalen om kommunernes økonomi for 1998.  Lovforslaget fastsætter endvidere kvoten for støttede private  andelsboliger for 1998. Endelig foreslås ændringer vedrørende  det statslige administrationsgebyr for nyt  andelsboligbyggeri.      Ændring af byggeloven  (X)      Som opfølgning af Handicapudvalgets arbejde og  Boligministeriets handlingsplan fra maj 1997 foreslås bl.a.  en udvidelse af den eksisterende klageadgang. Der vil desuden  blive foreslået mindre, tekniske ændringer og moderniseringer  af loven.      Ændring af lov om fremme af byggeriets udvikling  (X)      Som led i en opprioritering af det erhvervsmæssige område er  det besluttet, at Byggeriets Udviklingsråd skal være et  egentligt rådgivende organ for boligministeren og  Boligministeriet. Rådet skal bl.a. fungere som tænketank  vedrørende generelle byggepolitiske emner og udføre analyse-  og udviklingsopgaver for ministeriet og byggesektoren i  øvrigt.       På den baggrund foreslås lovens formålsbestemmelse  ændret, ligesom de i loven fastsatte regler om rådets  størrelse og repræsentantskabet foreslås ændret.      Ændring af lov om bygnings- og boligregistrering      Der vil bl.a. blive foreslået en ophævelse af forbudet mod  anvendelse af ejendomsdata i forbindelse med markedsføring og  bestemmelser om samarbejde med forsyningsvirksomheder.      Lov om adresser      Lovforslaget indebærer en samling af en række gældende  lovbestemmelser om adressering i én lov. Samtidig udvides og  præciseres kommunalbestyrelsernes ansvar for tildeling og  ajourføring af adresser. Med forslaget styrkes grundlaget for  en bedre udnyttelse m.v. af data på ejendomsområdet.      Ændring af lov om elektriske stærkstrømsanlæg og elektrisk  materiel      Med forslaget indføres hjemmel til, at Elektricitetsrådet kan  pålægge elforsyningsselskaberne at føre tilsyn med elektriske  installationer. Forslaget betyder endvidere, at private og  offentlige selskaber stilles ens for så vidt angår tilsyn med  stærkstrømsanlæg.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af lov om andelsboliger og andre boligfællesskaber      På baggrund af forarbejderne til lov nr. 383 af 10. juni 1997  vedrørende stop for arrest og udlæg i en andel i en  andelsboligforening arbejdes der videre med spørgsmålet om  udlæg i og afholdelse af tvangsauktion over andele i  andelsboligforeninger med henblik på eventuelt via lovgivning  at løse udestående problemer.      Boligministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelser:      - Byggepolitisk redegørelse      Handlingsplan for tilgængelighed for handicappede i byggeriet      ERHVERVSMINISTEREN      Ændring af markedsføringsloven      I regeringens forbrugerpolitiske strategi, der blev  offentliggjort i april 1997, er det foreslået, at  forbrugernes retsstilling styrkes ved en række ændringer af  markedsføringsloven. Forslaget betyder en styrkelse af  Forbrugerombudsmanden. Det foreslås bl.a., at aftaler mellem  Forbrugerombudsmanden og en branche skal være bindende, og at  Forbrugerombudsmanden på visse områder får mulighed for at  udstede forbud/påbud over for erhvervsdrivende. Forslaget  betyder også, at reglerne om garanti i markedsføringsloven  styrkes, og at det tværgående markedsføringstilsyn styrkes.      Lov om et uafhængigt center for forbrugerinformation      Som led i den forbrugerpolitiske strategi foreslås også  oprettet et uafhængigt center for forbrugerinformation.  Lovforslaget indeholder regler om centrets opbygning,  styrelse og opgaver.      Ændring af lov om erhvervsfremme (Etablering og drift af  innovationsmiljøer)  (X)      Som en del af den politiske aftale om bedre vilkår for nye  virksomheder, jf. Akt 236 21. maj 1997, kan  Erhvervsministeriet medfinansiere etablering og drift af en  række innovationsmiljøer. Med lovforslaget sikres hjemmel  til, at kompetencen til at bevilge statslig forprojektkapital  kan overføres til innovationsmiljøerne.      Ændring af lov om omsætning af fast ejendom  (X)      Lovforslaget er en opfølgning på Erhvervsministeriets  Boligrapport og indeholder bl.a. forslag vedrørende  godkendelse af etiske regler og branchekodeks, specifikation  af formidlerens regning, aftalefrihed med hensyn til  formidlerens vederlag, regler for annoncering, annoncering  på internettet, forenkling af oplysningskrav og adgang til  frivillige auktioner over ejendomme.      Ændring af lov om skibsregistrering og søloven  (X)      Som et led i regelforenklingsindsatsen ændres en række  registrerings- og anmeldelsesregler. Der sker endvidere  justering af kravene til anpartsselskaber, der er ejere af  registrerede skibe.      Ændring af bogføringsloven  (X)      Lovforslaget medfører en forenkling, således at loven gøres  mere brugervenlig for virksomhederne. Endvidere moderniseres  lovens regler om opbevaring af regnskabsmateriale, således at  der tages hensyn til udviklingen i  informationsteknologien.      Lov om ophævelse af lov om Foreningsregistret  (X)      Efter gennemførelsen af lov om Det Centrale  Virksomhedsregister (CVR) og lov om erhvervsdrivende  virksomheder er der ikke længere behov for at opretholde et  særligt foreningsregister. Loven herom foreslås derfor  ophævet.      Lov om ophævelse af lov om fordeling af visse fra udlandet  modtagne erstatninger m.v  (X)      Loven, der omhandler, hvorledes økonomisk kompensation for  overgreb på danskejet ejendom i udlandet skal fordeles,  ophæves, da den ikke længere har nogen praktisk betydning.      Ændring af patentloven, brugsmodelloven og mønsterloven  (X)      Lovforslaget bringer den danske patentlov i overensstemmelse  med gennemførelsesreglerne til Den Europæiske  Patentkonvention om deponering af biologisk materiale, der  trådte i kraft den 1. oktober 1996.       Som led i regelforenklingen giver lovforslaget desuden  ansøgere mulighed for elektronisk indlevering af dokumenter,  herunder ansøgninger til Patentdirektoratet. Forslaget  indebærer også en række moderniseringer og rationaliseringer  af reglerne.      Ændring af lov om skibes sikkerhed  (X)      Forslaget medfører en række mindre tekniske justeringer i  loven bl.a. vedrørende reglerne om arbejdsdelingen mellem  Søfartsstyrelsen og klassifikationsselskaberne,  gebyrbestemmelserne og straffebestemmelserne.      Ændring af lov om betalingskort m.v.  (X)      Forslaget betyder en udsættelse af den i lovens § 37  forudsatte revision i folketingsåret 1997/98. På baggrund af  den hurtige udvikling på betalingsformidlingsområdet  gennemføres en række pilotprojekter og undersøgelser. Det  skønnes mest hensigtsmæssigt, at en lovrevision afventer  resultaterne af disse projekter og undersøgelser.      Ændring af lov om statsautoriserede revisorer og lov om  registrerede revisorer  (X)      Som følge af overførsel af kvalifikationseksamen for  registrerede revisorer fra Undervisningsministeriet til  Erhvervsministeriet skal der gennemføres mindre, tekniske  ændringer i lovgivningen.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Lov om Rådets forordning (EF) om beskyttelse mod  eksterritorial lovgivning vedtaget af et tredjeland      Lovforslaget supplerer forordningen med de forudsatte  nationale straffebestemmelser og udpeger  Erhvervsfremmestyrelsen som kompetent myndighed for de  informationer, der skal finde sted mellem berørte  virksomheder, personer og Europa-Kommissionen.      Erhvervsministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Den erhvervspolitiske redegørelse      FINANSMINISTEREN      Finanslov for finansåret 1998  (X)      Lov om tillægsbevilling for finansåret 1997      Finanslov for finansåret 1999      Ændring af lov om tjenestemænd og lov om tjenestemandspension  (X)      Som følge af den foretagne revision af lov om arbejdsretten,  der blev vedtaget den 27. februar 1997, foreslås ændringer i  tjenestemandslovens bestemmelser om tjenestemandsretten. Det  har endvidere vist sig ønskeligt at forenkle og modernisere  visse andre bestemmelser i tjenestemandsloven, bl.a.  bestemmelserne om ansættelse af EU-borgere.       Som konsekvens af de foreslåede ændringer i  tjenestemandsloven foreslås en mindre ændring af  tjenestemandspensionsloven.      Ændring af lov om pensionering af civilt personel i forsvaret      Som led i opfølgningen på overenskomstforhandlingerne  foreslås tilgangen til civilarbejderpensionsordningen lukket,  således at loven alene omfatter personel, der er ansat den  31. marts 1998 eller tidligere.      Ændring af lov om statsgaranterede studielån og lov om  tilskud  til afvikling af studiegæld og om eftergivelse af  studiegæld   (X)      Formålet med forslaget er at lempe reglerne for  tilbagebetaling og eftergivelse af statsgaranterede lån.  Forslaget sigter mod en nedsættelse af renten for  statsgaranterede studielån ved tilbud om refinansiering i  Hypotekbankens bankvirksomhed. Endvidere skal låntagere på et  tidligere tidspunkt kunne danne sig et overblik over  mulighederne og vilkårene for eftergivelse af deres gæld.      Lov om tilskud til Grønlands hjemmestyre      Den nuværende lov om tilskud til Grønlands hjemmestyre  udløber med udgangen af 1998. Regeringen og hjemmestyret har  indledt forhandlinger om tilskuddet efter 1998, og der  forventes fremsat lovforslag herom i februar 1998.      Lov om tilskud til Færøernes hjemmestyre      Den nuværende lov om tilskud til Færøernes hjemmestyre  udløber med udgangen af 1998. Regeringen og hjemmestyret har  indledt forhandlinger om tilskuddet efter 1998, og der  forventes fremsat lovforslag herom i marts 1998.      FORSKNINGSMINISTEREN      Lov om digital signatur      Lovforslaget indebærer mulighed for at kunne underskrive  digitale dokumenter ved hjælp af en såkaldt »digital  signatur«. Forslaget opstiller de tekniske og juridiske  rammer for anvendelsen af den digitale signatur, herunder en  autorisationsordning for nøglecentre, der skal kunne  verificere den enkeltes digitale signatur over for  omverdenen. Lovforslaget sidestiller dermed generelt den  digitale signatur med en egenhændig underskrift. Lovforslaget  er en opfølgning på redegørelsen fra bl.a.  forskningsministeren, justitsministeren og erhvervsministeren  om ligestilling af digital og papirbaseret kommunikation.      Lov om Statstidende      Formålet med forslaget er at revidere og ajourføre den  eksisterende Statstidendelov fra 1903. Loven skal skabe  grundlag for at udgive Statstidende i elektronisk form. Den  almindelige retsvirkning af en offentliggørelse knyttes til  den elektroniske offentliggørelse, når der er etableret  almindelig adgang til den elektroniske udgave på  folkebibliotekerne. Loven indeholder desuden en række  bestemmelser om den skriftlige udgave, som først ophører, når  den almindelige elektroniske adgang er sikret.      Lov om overdragelse af den samlede kompetence på teleområdet  til Grønlands hjemmestyre  (X)      Lovforslaget omhandler overdragelse af den samlede  lovgivnings- og myndighedskompetence vedrørende  telekommunikation i Grønland og mellem Grønland og omverdenen  til det Grønlandske hjemmestyre. Forslaget fremsættes efter  aftale med hjemmestyret.       Lovforslaget samt de nedenfor anførte yderligere  lovforslag på forskningsministerens område er en opfølgning  af den politiske aftale om teleliberalisering.      Lovgivning om forbrugerbeskyttelse på teleområdet      Lovgivningen vedrører bl.a. udbygning af oplysningspligten  over for forbrugerne med hensyn til abonnements- og  aftalevilkår og konsekvenserne af manglende opfyldelse fra  teleselskabets side. Forslaget vil sikre ensartede regler for  udbud af alle former for offentlige teletjenester - telefoni,  datakommunikation, mobilkommunikation - til brugere på de  nævnte områder.      Lov om etablering og fællesudnyttelse af master til  radiokommunikationsformål m.v. (Grøn mastelovgivning og  prisregulering af roaming)      Forslaget omhandler bl.a. rammerne for etablering og  udnyttelse af master til radiokommunikationsformål. Sigtet er  en »grøn« mastelovgivning, der sikrer en udstrakt fælles  udnyttelse af eksisterende og nye master. Forslaget vil  samtidig medvirke til at sikre bl.a. nye mobilselskaber  reelle muligheder for at etablere egen radioinfrastruktur og  til at sikre reel adgang til etablering af  radiokædeforbindelser m.v. Forslaget vil eventuelt også  omfatte en udbygning af den eksisterende lovgivning om adgang  til videreformidling m.v.      Ændring af lov om graveadgang og ekspropriation m.v. til  telekommunikationsformål      Lovgivningen vedrører bl.a. rammer for lige og åben adgang  til offentlige myndigheders og forsyningsvirksomheders  arealer og kabelføringsveje, herunder rammer, der sikrer åbne  og offentlige udbudsprocedurer, rammer for omkostningsdeling  m.v.      Ændring af lov om teleterminaludstyr og ændring af lov om  beskyttelse mod elektromagnetiske forstyrrelser      Lovgivningen omhandler en generel revision af den gældende  lovgivning om standardisering, specifikation, typegodkendelse  m.v. af teleterminaludstyr samt den gældende lovgivning om  elektromagnetisk udstråling.      Ændring af lov om radio- og fjernsynsvirksomhed (Ophævelse af  den tekniske detailregulering af fællesantenneområdet)  (X)      Forslaget omhandler ophævelse af den tekniske  detailregulering på fællesantenneområdet. Forslaget skal dels  sikre overensstemmelse med den øvrige lovgivning på  teleområdet, dels overensstemmelse med gældende EU-regler.      Ændring af lov om visse forhold på telekommunikationsområdet  (Afvikling af koncessionslovgivningen for Tele Danmark)      Forslaget vedrører ophævelse af den koncessionslovgivning,  der danner grundlaget for Tele Danmarks tidligere eneret på  visse dele af telekommunikationsområdet.      Ændring af lov om visse forhold på telekommunikationsområdet  (Regler for service 900-tjenester, overtakserede tjenester)      Formålet med lovgivningen er at forenkle regelsættet og  fortsætte den nødvendige forbrugerbeskyttelse på området.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Lovgivning vedrørende År 2000-problemet      Der kan være behov for lovgivning i forbindelse med det  såkaldte År 2000-problem, der vedrører fejl i edb-systemer og  elektronik ved overgangen til det næste århundrede.      Forskningsministeren vil give Folketinget følgende  redegørelse:      - Redegørelse om ligestilling af digital og papirbaseret  kommunikation. (Sammen med bl.a. erhvervsministeren og  justitsministeren)      FORSVARSMINISTEREN      Ændring af lov om forsvarets personel og andre love  (X)      Lovændringerne skal muliggøre etablering af en ordning,  hvorefter kvinder generelt kan antages i forsvaret på  værnepligtslignende vilkår. Det forudsættes, at kvinderne  fuldt ud skal træde i stedet for værnepligtige mænd og  erstatte et tilsvarende antal mænd i mobiliseringsstyrken.  Der foretages konsekvensændringer af lov om ferie og lov om  orlov inden for arbejdministerens område.       Lovændringerne vil også omfatte en række justeringer og  tekniske ændringer af reglerne om godtgørelse, pensionsmæssig  sikring m.v. i forbindelse med tjeneste i udlandet.      FØDEVAREMINISTEREN      Lov om fødevarer      Med lovforslaget tilsigtes en modernisering og samling af  lovreglerne om fødevarer i én lov. Formålet er at skabe en  forenklet og overskuelig lovgivning og at gennemføre en  modernisering af kontrolsystemet. Der sigtes mod en styrkelse  af forbrugerbeskyttelsen og forbrugeroplysningen samt at  skabe klare og gennemskuelige rammer for erhvervenes  virksomhed.      Lov om økologisk jordbrugsproduktion      Interessen for økologiske produkter er stigende. Som en  konsekvens heraf og som led i opprioriteringen af de  økologiske hensyn samt et ønske om at styrke lovgivningen på  området fremsættes forslag om en særlig økologilov ved at  udskille strukturlovens regler om økologi fra denne lov.      Ændring af lov om læhegn og tilskud til læplantning  (X)      Ifølge den gældende lov er læplantning først og fremmest en  kulturteknisk foranstaltning rettet mod jordbrugsarealer. På  trods af deres landskabsmæssige og lægivende betydning er  beplantninger omkring bygninger, gylletanke og tekniske anlæg  ikke omfattet af lovens formål, og mange af denne type  læplantninger er i forfald. Formålet med lovændringen er, at  der også skal kunne ydes tilskud til denne type  beplantninger.      Ændring af lov om tilskud til produktudvikling af jordbrugs-  og fiskeriprodukter  (X)      Lovforslaget præciserer retningslinjerne og betingelserne for  at yde støtte til forsøgsfiskeri og videnskabelige  undersøgelser, der udføres med henblik på undersøgelse af  alternative fiskemuligheder, fangstteknikker m.v. Desuden  indføres bemyndigelse til at yde støtte til produktudvikling  i det primære fiskeri. Herudover forventes forslaget at  indeholde enkelte mindre justeringer af lovens regler.      Ændring af lov om husdyrsygdomme  (X)      Som følge af EU-regler søges der skabt hjemmel til at  godkende personer, der handler med husdyr. Der forventes også  behov for at ændre bestemmelserne om Det Centrale  Husdyrbrugsregister med henblik på at muliggøre registrering  af forbruget af veterinærmedicin og antibiotiske  vækstfremmere. Endelig forventes der foretaget ændring af  reglerne om bekæmpelse af sygdomme hos akvakulturdyr gennem  tørlægning af dambrug.      Ændring af lov om saltvandsfiskeri      Der ønskes gennemført stramninger af reglerne om retten til  at drive erhvervsfiskeri. Reglerne skal sikre en mere  konsekvent anvendelse af reguleringssystemerne.      Regelændringerne sker i sammenhæng med kapacitetsreguleringen  for flåden. I forbindelse hermed ønskes forbedrede muligheder  for efterprøvelse af erhvervsfiskerstatus med henblik på at  sikre den fortsatte erhvervsfiskerindflydelse.      Ændring af lov om regulering af fiskeriet      I sammenhæng med ændring af lov om saltvandsfiskeri  forberedes stramninger af reglerne om tilladelse til at  anvende fartøjer til erhvervsmæssigt fiskeri. Ændringerne  skal sikre grundlaget for reguleringen på området og en  fremadrettet politik for flådekapaciteten, hvor indførelse af  mulighed for en mere fleksibel adgang til nybygninger stiller  større krav til efterprøvning af fartøjernes  erhvervstilknytning.      Ændring af lov om førstegangsomsætning af fisk      Som led i en gennemgang af det gældende bevillingssystem for  fiskeauktioner forventes fremlagt forslag om en  liberalisering af adgangen til at drive fiskeauktion.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Lov om tilbageføring af grønne afgifter (CO2 og SO2-afgifter)  i jordbrugssektoren      Jordbrugserhvervet har hidtil fået CO2- og SO2-afgifter  tilbageført via især gebyrnedsættelser på plante- og  veterinærområdet. Erhvervet har i stedet ønsket en mere  direkte tilbageføringsmodel. Der overvejes en tilbageføring  opgjort på grundlag af momsbelagt omsætning i  jordbrugsvirksomheder.      Ændring af lov om foderstoffer  (X)      Forslaget er et led i regeringens plan for at reducere  forbruget af antibiotika i fødevareproduktionen. Med  lovforslaget udvides adgangen til at fastsætte regler om  oplysningspligt for foderstofvirksomheder og landmænd, bl.a.  således at myndighederne på bedriftsniveau kan få et overblik  over forbruget af de nævnte tilsætningsstoffer.      Ændring af lov om dyrlægegerning m.v.  (X)      På grundlag af arbejdet i et fagligt udvalg forventes  ligeledes fremsat forslag om indførelse af en central  registrering af terapeutisk brug af antibiotika og  vækstfremmere i Det Centrale Hysdyrbrugsregister.      Ændring af lov om støtte til jordbrugets strukturudvikling og  til økologisk jordbrug (strukturloven)      De påtænke ændringer vedrører dels en tilpasning af de  miljøvenlige jordbrugsforanstaltninger, dels foranstaltninger  til forbedring af produktion og afsætning af honning.      Fødevareministeren vil give Folketinget følgende  redegørelser:      - Fødevarepolitisk redegørelse  - Redegørelse om forskellige gødningsformers betydning for  udvaskningen      INDENRIGSMINISTEREN      Ændring af lov om kommunernes styrelse og beredskabsloven  (Åbne udvalgsdagsordener m.v.)  (X)      Efter lovforslaget skal dagsordener for kommunalbestyrelsens  og amtsrådets udvalg generelt være offentligt tilgængelige  med de begrænsninger, der følger af reglerne om  tavshedspligt. Endvidere foreslås lovbestemte minimumsfrister  for udsendelse af dagsorden til møderne i kommunalbestyrelser  og amtsråd samt fremlæggelse af materiale til medlemmers  gennemsyn.      Ændring af lov om kommuners og amtskommuners udførelse af  opgaver for andre offentlige myndigheder      Det følger af revisionsbestemmelse i loven, at denne skal  tages op til revision i folketingsåret 1997/98. Der er nedsat  et udvalg, der skal foretage en vurdering af, hvilke  erfaringer der er indvundet med loven. Udvalgets arbejde skal  være afsluttet i januar 1998. Der vil på denne baggrund blive  taget stilling til, i hvilket omfang der måtte være behov for  ændringer af loven.      Ændring af gebyrloven (Lov om gebyrer og morarenter  vedrørende visse ydelser, der opkræves eller inddrives af  amtskommuner og kommuner)  (X)      Forslaget medfører en ændring af gebyrloven således, at det  maksimale gebyr, der kan opkræves af amtskommuner og kommuner  ved udsendelse af erindringsskrivelser, tilsigelser til  udlægsforretninger og udsendelse af begæring om  lønindeholdelse forhøjes fra 200 kr. til 250 kr. Forhøjelsen  af gebyret er et led i aftalen mellem regeringen og KL om  kommunernes økonomi i 1998 og indgår i en generel forbedring  af mulighederne for at inddrive offentlige restancer.      Ændring af lov om folketingsvalg i Grønland      Formålet med lovforslaget er at erstatte den hidtidige  ordning med personlige stedfortrædere med en ordning,  hvorefter de ikkevalgte kandidater af samme parti henholdsvis  kandidatforbund indtræder som stedfortrædere i tilfælde af  midlertidig eller varig mandatledighed. Formålet med  forslaget er endvidere at åbne mulighed for, at der kan  brevstemmes på skibe hjemmehørende i Grønland, uanset om  disse sejler i indenrigsfart samt at lovfæste fristen for  indlevering af kandidatanmeldelser.      Ændring af lov om fordeling mellem staten, kommunerne og  amtskommunerne af skattenedslaget som følge af  personskattelovens skatteloft      Det er fastsat i loven, at forslag til revision skal  fremsættes for Folketinget i folketingsåret 1997-98.      Lov om ø-støtte og færgestøtte (X)      Der fremsættes forslag til etablering af en ny  investeringsstøtte til færger på mindre øer. Loven erstatter  bestemmelser, der i dag findes i ø-støtteloven under Miljø-  og Energiministeriet.      Lov om integration      Lovforslaget fremsættes med udgangspunkt i erfaringerne fra  de seneste 4 års integrationsarbejde samt på baggrund af en  betænkning afgivet den 16. maj 1997 af det af  indenrigsministeren nedsatte Integrationsudvalg og de  høringssvar, der er indkommet fra en række myndigheder og  organisationer efter betænkningens afgivelse.       Det vil være forslagets målsætning at gøre  integrationsindsatsen mere individuelt tilpasset med henblik  på at styrke den enkelte udlændings muligheder for at  etablere et liv som selvhjulpen.       Lovforslaget skal lægge op til en bedre kombination af  intensiv sprogtræning og intensiv jobforberedelse samt større  fleksibilitet i integrationsperiodens længde. Forslaget skal  samtidig præcisere den enkelte udlændings egne pligter.      Ændring af udlændingeloven (Udvisning med indrejseforbud)  (X)      Der vil blive fremsat lovforslag vedrørende ændringer af  udlændingelovens regler om udvisning.       Lovforslaget fremsættes med udgangspunkt i en betænkning  afgivet den 16. april 1997 af det af indenrigsministeren  nedsatte Udvisningsudvalg og på baggrund af eventuelle  bemærkninger fra de myndigheder og organisationer,  betænkningen er blevet sendt til høring hos.       Udvisningsbetænkningen indeholder bl.a. forslag til  ændringer, der indebærer en forenkling og justering af  udlændingelovens bestemmelser om udvisning. Forslaget  indeholder endvidere præciseringer og justeringer af  procedurerne i forbindelse med udvisning.      Lov om Det Centrale Personregister (CPR)      Lovforslaget fremsættes for at erstatte  folkeregistreringsloven fra 1968 med en tidssvarende lov,  hvor borgernes grundlæggende rettigheder og pligter med  hensyn til folkeregistreringen samt adgangen til udnyttelse  af de registrerede oplysninger fremgår af selve lovteksten.       Der foretages en nødvendig tilpasning til det lovforslag  om beskyttelse af personoplysninger m.v., der fremsættes af  justitsministeren for at implementere Rådets direktiv om  beskyttelse af fysiske personer i forbindelse med behandling  af personoplysninger og om fri udveksling af sådanne  oplysninger.      Ændring af værnepligtsloven  (X)      Lovforslaget indeholder bl.a. forslag om en skærpelse af  reglerne for tidligere straffede personers adgang til at  aftjene værnepligt. Forslaget indeholder endvidere ændringer  om færingers og grønlænderes værnepligt under ophold i  Danmark samt delvis ændring af Værnepligtsnævnets funktion og  sammensætning  m.v.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af lov om valg til Folketinget og ændring af lov om  kommunale valg      Der skal eventuelt gennemføres tekniske ændringer af reglerne  om brevstemmeafgivning i institutioner, der drives efter  reglerne i bistandsloven, som følge af ikrafttræden pr. 1.  juli 1998 af lov om social service, der delvis træder i  stedet for bistandsloven.      Ændring af udlændingeloven (Familiesammenføring)      Det overvejes at fremsætte lovforslag om socialt retfærdige  og forenklede regler i udlændingeloven om forsørgelseskravet  i familiesammenføringssager med ægtefæller.      Ændring af lov om kommunal udligning og generelle tilskud til  kommuner og amtskommuner      Lovforslaget er en opfølgning på regeringens redegørelse til  Folketinget om landdistrikterne. Hensigten er, at kommuner  fra en pulje skal kunne ansøge om støtte til kommunal  finansiering af en række udviklingsprojekter under udvalgte  EU-støtteordninger. Puljen foreslås oprettet i tilknytning  til den pulje, der er afsat til særlig vanskeligt stillede  kommuner og finansieres af bloktilskuddet.      Indenrigsministeren vil give Folketinget følgende  redegørelse:      - Landdistriktsredegørelse      JUSTITSMINISTEREN      Lov om Domstolsstyrelsen  (X)      Lovforslaget er med nogle ændringer en genfremsættelse af et  lovforslag, L 275, der blev fremsat i maj 1997.       Lovforslaget er udarbejdet på grundlag af  Domstolsudvalgets betænkning nr. 1319/1996 og har til formål  at markere domstolenes uafhængige stilling ved etablering af  en selvstændig domstolsstyrelse, som skal have til opgave at  varetage de bevillingsmæssige og administrative opgaver i  relation til domstolenes virksomhed.       Efter forslaget skal domstolsadministrationen fortsat  ressortmæssigt være en del af Justitsministeriets område, men  justitsministeren skal ikke have instruktionsbeføjelser over  for Domstolsstyrelsen, og det retlige ansvar for  Domstolsstyrelsens virksomhed vil som konsekvens heraf alene  påhvile Domstolsstyrelsens bestyrelse.      Ændring af retsplejeloven, tjenestemandsloven og forskellige  andre love (rekruttering af dommere, dommerfuldmægtiges  ansættelsesvilkår, dommeres bierhverv og ændringer som følge  af oprettelse af en domstolsstyrelse m.v.)  (X)      Lovforslaget er med nogle ændringer en genfremsættelse af et  lovforslag, L 276, der blev fremsat i maj 1997.       Lovforslaget bygger på Domstolsudvalgets betænkning nr.  1319/1996 og har til formål at gennemføre en række ændringer  af retsplejelovens regler som konsekvens af den ændring i  strukturen for domstolenes administration, der foreslås  gennemført i forslag til lov om Domstolsstyrelsen.       Lovforslaget har endvidere til formål at opnå en bredere  og mere gennemsigtig dommerrekruttering. Som led heri  foreslås bl.a., at der i retsplejeloven angives en række  kriterier, som skal tillægges vægt ved besættelse af  dommerstillinger, og at der skabes mulighed for, at advokater  kan konstitueres som dommere i en kortere periode. Det  foreslås desuden, at der oprettes et dommerudnævnelsesråd.      Ændring af lov om frihedsberøvelse og anden tvang i  psykiatrien og retsplejeloven (Revision af psykiatriloven)  (X)      Lovforslaget er med nogle ændringer en genfremsættelse af et  lovforslag, der blev fremsat i december 1996.       Lovforslagets formål er en revision af psykiatriloven  fra 1989 som følge af en revisionsbestemmelse i loven. Et  hovedpunkt i lovforslaget er en forenkling af klageordningen.  Der foreslås også bestemmelser, der skal sikre en hurtig  behandling af klagerne. Herudover indeholder lovforslaget en  ændring af lovens regel om god sygehusstandard. Blandt de  øvrige ændringer kan nævnes et forslag om, at en klage ikke  skal tillægges opsættende virkning, hvis tvangsbehandling er  nødvendig for at afværge, at patienten udsætter andre for  nærliggende fare.      Love om indfødsrets meddelelse  (X)      Ved de tre årlige love om indfødsrets meddelelse får et antal  udenlandske statsborgere dansk indfødsret.      Ændring af lov om offentlighed i forvaltningen (aktindsigt i  personalesager) (X)      Justitsministeriet har nedsat en arbejdsgruppe vedrørende  aktindsigt i personalesager. Arbejdsgruppen har bl.a. til  opgave at overveje, om der er behov for lovændringer på  området og i givet fald at udarbejde udkast til sådanne  ændringer. Arbejdsgruppen forventes at afgive betænkning i  løbet af kort tid. På grundlag af arbejdsgruppens betænkning  vil der blive fremsat lovforslag om ændring af  offentlighedsloven vedrørende aktindsigt i personalesager.      Ændring af adoptionsloven (undersøgelses- og  godkendelsesforløb, aldersforskel, antal børn m.v.)  (X)      På baggrund af Adoptionsudvalgets betænkning nr. 1338/1997 om  international adoption foreslås en ændring af  adoptionslovgivningens regler om det undersøgelses- og  godkendelsesforløb, som kommende adoptanter skal igennem.  Formålet er, at adoptanterne får en højere grad af  medbestemmelse og ansvar i forbindelse med adoption samtidig  med, at myndighedernes kontrolfunktion træder i baggrunden.  Lovforslaget vil endvidere indeholde forslag om ændring af  reglerne om bl.a. aldersforskel mellem adoptanter og  adoptivbørn og om det antal børn, et ægtepar kan adoptere.      Ændring af lov om registreret partnerskab (udenlandske  statsborgeres adgang til at indgå registreret partnerskab i  Danmark)  (X)      Efter lov om registreret partnerskab er det i Danmark en  betingelse for at indgå registreret partnerskab, at mindst  en af parterne har bopæl i Danmark og er dansk statsborger.  Det foreslås, at norske, svenske og islandske statsborgere  sidestilles med danske statsborgere i relation til indgåelse  af registreret partnerskab. Det foreslås endvidere, at  justitsministeren bemyndiges til at bestemme, at statsborgere  i andre lande, der senere måtte få en lov om registreret  partnerskab svarende til den danske, også sidestilles med  danske statsborgere.      Ændring af retsplejeloven (Beslaglæggelse og edition,  fotoforevisning, konfrontation, efterlysning og observation  samt anvendelse af agenter)  (X)      På grundlag af to betænkninger fra Strafferetsplejeudvalget  foreslås retsplejelovens regler om beslaglæggelse og  edition ændret, og der foreslås regler i retsplejeloven for  politiets anvendelse af fotoforevisning, konfrontation,  efterlysning og observation under efterforskning. Endvidere  vil lovforslaget eventuelt indeholde forslag til en  præcisering af reglerne for politiets adgang til at anvende  agenter.      Ændring af retsplejeloven (samarbejdet mellem retterne og  pressen)  (X)      Et udvalg under Justitsministeriet har i marts 1997 afgivet  en betænkning om samarbejdet mellem retterne og pressen.       I betænkningen foreslås ændringer af retsplejeloven, der  medfører en udvidet adgang for medierne til aktindsigt i  domstolenes sager. Det foreslås også, at journalister får  adgang til at udtale sig, inden retten træffer afgørelse om  dørlukning og om referat- og navneforbud, og at medierne får  adgang til at kære rettens afgørelser herom. Herudover  indeholder betænkningen bl.a. forslag om adgangen til at  tegne og bruge referatbåndoptager under retsmøder.  Betænkningen har været sendt til høring og har været forelagt  Retsplejerådet.      Ændring af straffeloven m.v. (Afkriminalisering af  prostitution m.v.)      Det foreslås at ophæve straffelovens bestemmelse om lediggang  under sådanne forhold, at der er grund til at antage, at man  ikke ernærer sig på lovlig vis, herunder ved prostitution.  Bestemmelsen anvendes ikke længere i praksis, og navnlig vil  en afkriminalisering af prostitution kunne forbedre de  sociale myndigheders muligheder for at få kontakt med og  støtte de prostituerede. Uden for det strafferetlige område  vil prostitution fortsat ikke være lovligt erhverv.  Lovforslaget vil indeholde den nødvendige følgelovgivning i  den forbindelse. Der foreslås endvidere bl.a. en  modernisering af straffelovens bestemmelser om alfonseri m.v.      Ændring af våben- og eksplosivstofloven      Loven vil blive foreslået ændret på en række punkter,  herunder vedrørende lyddæmpere, teleskopsigtemidler, kraftige  luftdrevne våben og blyhagl. Endvidere vil der blive stillet  forslag til en bemyndigelsesbestemmelse, der gør det muligt  at fastsætte nye regler om skydebaner og  feltskydningsterræner.      Ændring af kasinoloven      Lovforslaget fremsættes på grundlag af en  revisionsbestemmelse i den nugældende kasinolov. Forslaget  vil endvidere indeholde forslag til regler om spil i  restaurationer og spillehaller på baggrund af en betænkning  fra forlystelsesudvalget, der forventes afgivet i efteråret  1997.      Ændring af dyreværnsloven      Der forventes snarest at ville blive fastsat administrative  bestemmelser om privates hold af farlige dyr samt om  erhvervsmæssig opdræt af og handel med dyr. I tilknytning  hertil samt i forbindelse med regler om zoologiske haver vil  der være behov for at få tilvejebragt et særlig sagkyndigt  råd, der kan bistå politiet i forbindelse med de sager, der  forelægges politiet på de nævnte områder. I tilknytning  hertil vil der ligeledes blive foreslået regler om  brugerbetaling i forbindelse med ansøgninger om hold af  farlige dyr samt om godkendelser af dyrehandler og  zoologiske haver.      Ændring af lov om hittegods      På grundlag af en udtalelse fra en arbejdsgruppe under  Justitsministeriet vil der blive fremsat forslag om  præcisering af de gældende regler om hittegods, herunder om  afleveringsfrister, opbevaringstid m.v.      Ændring af lov om mærkning af cykelstel      Loven foreskriver, at mærkning skal ske ved indhugning i  stellet. På baggrund af henvendelser fra cykelfabrikanter og  anbefalinger fra en arbejdsgruppe under Rigspolitichefen vil  loven blive foreslået ændret, således at stelmærkning ud over  ved indhugning skal kunne foretages på lignende godkendt  måde, der ved prægning i materialet sikrer, at stelmærkningen  ikke let kan fjernes.      Ændring af straffeloven og forskellige andre love (grove  overtrædelser af momsloven og bedrageri med hensyn til midler  fra De Europæiske Fællesskabers budgetter m.v.)      Rådet for Den Europæiske Union har vedtaget en konvention om  beskyttelse af De Europæiske Fællesskabers finansielle  interesser (svigskonventionen). Ved lovforslaget gennemføres  de lovændringer, der er nødvendige for, at Danmark kan  ratificere denne konvention. Endvidere foreslås det, at grove  overtrædelser af momsloven bliver omfattet af straffelovens §  289 om groft skattesvig, som har en strafferamme på 4 år.      Lov om politiklagenævn i Grønland      Den Grønlandske Retsvæsenskommission har foreslået, at der  forud for afslutningen af arbejdet i kommissionen gennemføres  en lov om behandling af klager over politipersonalet i  Grønland. Kommissionens forslag vil danne grundlag for et  lovforslag om oprettelse af et grønlandsk politiklagenævn,  der på centrale punkter vil ligne den danske ordning.  Lovforslaget skal inden fremsættelsen forelægges for  Grønlands hjemmestyre.      Ændring af retsplejeloven (instansordningen i civile sager)      Retsplejerådet har behandlet spørgsmålet om  kompetencefordelingen mellem byretter, landsretter og  Højesteret. Formålet har først og fremmest været at overveje  behovet for en vis omlægning af de sagstyper, der i dag  behandles af Højesteret. Betænkningen fra Retsplejerådet vil  foreligge i løbet af kort tid. Betænkningen vil efter en  høring danne baggrund for et lovforslag om ændring af  retsplejeloven.      Lov om beskyttelse af personoplysninger m.v.      På baggrund af den betænkning, som forventes afgivet i  november 1997 af Udvalget om Registerlovgivningen, vil der  blive fremsat forslag til en ny lov om beskyttelse af  personoplysninger m.v. Formålet med lovforslaget er primært  at sikre en korrekt implementering af Europa-Parlamentet og  Rådets direktiv 95/46/EF af 24. oktober 1995 om beskyttelse  af fysiske personer i forbindelse med behandling af  personoplysninger og om fri udveksling af sådanne  oplysninger.  Herudover er formålet at skabe en mere  tidssvarende regulering af de forhold, som gør sig gældende i  forbindelse med, at elektronisk behandling m.v. af  personoplysninger finder sted.      Ændring af lov om forbud mod ophold i bestemte ejendomme      I loven om forbud mod ophold i bestemte ejendomme  (»rockerloven«) er det fastsat, at forslag til revision af  loven fremsættes for Folketinget i folketingsåret 1997-98.      Ændring af retsplejeloven (en mere enkel, hurtig og billig  behandling af småsager)      Justitsministeriets Småsags-udvalg vil i løbet af kort tid  afgive betænkning om en hurtigere og enklere behandling af  småsager. Betænkningen indeholder forslag om en særlig  procesform for visse retstvister af mindre værdi, sådan at  borgerne får adgang til rådgivning om og behandling af  sådanne krav på en let, hurtig og billig måde. Betænkningen  vil sammen med høringsudtalelser om betænkningen og en  udtalelse fra Retsplejerådet danne grundlag for et lovforslag  om ændring af bl.a. retsplejeloven.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af straffeloven (kompetencen til at straffe  seksualforbrydelser og omskæring af kvinder begået i  udlandet)   (X)      Justitsministeren vil over for Folketinget redegøre for  forholdene i en række lande med hensyn til strafbarheden af  visse seksualforbrydelser over for børn og af omskæring af  kvinder. Såfremt der er anledning hertil, vil der blive  forslået ændringer i straffelovens bestemmelse om, at  forhold, der begås i udlandet, også skal være strafbare i det  pågældende fremmede land.      Ændring af lov om svangerskabsafbrydelse (Grænsen mellem  abort og dødfødsel m.v.)      En arbejdsgruppe under Sundhedsstyrelsen har i en rapport  anbefalet, at grænsen for, hvornår der er tale om en spontan  abort, og hvornår der er tale om et dødfødt barn, nedsættes  fra udløbet af 28. graviditetsuge til udløbet af 22.  graviditetsuge. Rapporten har været til høring hos en lang  række myndigheder og organisationer. På den baggrund  overvejes det at ændre den nævnte grænse. Endelig kan der  eventuelt blive spørgsmål om at fastsætte en tidsmæssig  grænse for, hvornår en abort kan gennemføres. Etisk Råd har  netop afgivet en udtalelse om dette spørgsmål. Udtalelsen er  nu ved at blive sendt til høring.      Lov om fuldbyrdelse af straf m.v.      Straffelovrådet forventes i begyndelsen af 1998 at afgive  betænkning om en straffuldbyrdelseslov. På grundlag af  betænkningen og høringssvar vil der eventuelt blive fremsat  forslag til lov om fuldbyrdelse af straf m.v. Samtidig vil  der eventuelt blive fremsat forslag til ændringer i anden  lovgivning som følge af gennemførelsen af  straffuldbyrdelsesloven.      Ændring af forvaltningsloven (aktindsigt i sager om  straffuldbyrdelse)      Straffelovrådet har foreslået, at adgangen til  partsaktindsigt i sager vedrørende straffuldbyrdelse  begrænses for at undgå, at indsattes oplysninger til  fængselsmyndighederne misbruges af andre indsatte. Rådets  forslag, der skal ses i sammenhæng med en  straffuldbyrdelseslov, vil eventuelt danne grundlag for et  lovforslag om ændring af forvaltningslovens bestemmelser om  partsaktindsigt, således at retten til aktindsigt begrænses i  sager bl.a. om valg af afsoningsinstitution og overførsel  til anden afsoningsinstitution.      Justitsministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Redegørelse om reduktion af ventetider i retssystemet      KIRKEMINISTEREN      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af den kirkelige lovgivning på Færøerne      Kirkeministeriet har for øjeblikket et antal forslag til kgl.  anordninger om ikrafttræden på Færøerne af de kirkelige  hovedlove til høring hos det færøske Lagting. Forinden  anordningerne sættes i kraft på Færøerne, er det nødvendigt  at ophæve lov for Færøerne om kirkernes styrelse, ligesom der  skal foretages ændringer i enkelte bestemmelser i lov om  oprettelse af Færøernes Stift. Fremsættelse af lovforslag  beror på høringen af det færøske hjemmestyre.      Ændring af lov om ansættelse i stillinger i folkekirken m.v.      Der er nedsat en arbejdsgruppe, der skal vurdere behovet og  mulighederne for en mere fleksibel besættelse af  præstestillinger. Arbejdsgruppens overvejelser, der forventes  afsluttet sidst på året, kan betyde, at der skal foretages  mindre ændringer af loven.      KULTURMINISTEREN      Lov om Danmarks Biblioteksskole  (X)      Lovforslaget er en genfremsættelse af et lovforslag, L 274,  der blev fremsat i maj 1997.       Formålet med lovforslaget er at ændre den nuværende  bibliotekaruddannelse til en informationsvidenskabelig  uddannelse med et bredere sigte og en større fleksibilitet  som følge af informationssamfundet og arbejdsmarkedets behov.      Ændring af lov om radio- og fjernsynsvirksomhed  (X)      Lovforslaget har til formål dels at gennemføre direktivet af  30. juni 1997 om ændring af direktivet om »TV uden grænser«,  dels at gennemføre et forbud mod såkaldte piratdekodere.  Direktivet indeholder en bestemmelse om visning af  vigtige begivenheder (eksempelvis nationale og internationale  sportsbegivenheder) i tv. Bestemmelsen har til formål at  sikre, at en væsentlig del af befolkningen kan følge sådanne  begivenheder i tv uden at skulle betale ekstra for det. De  enkelte medlemslande har efter direktivet mulighed for at  udarbejde lister med sådanne begivenheder. Lovforslaget vil  dels indeholde en bestemmelse om, at danske tv-foretagender  skal respektere andre landes lister, dels en bemyndigelse for  ministeren til at udarbejde en dansk liste.  Endvidere vil lovforslaget indeholde et forbud mod  erhvervsmæssig omsætning af piratdekoderkort eller andet  udstyr, som muliggør uautoriseret adgang til krypterede  radio- eller tv-udsendelser. Der findes på nuværende  tidspunkt ikke i dansk lovgivning et direkte forbud mod  piratdekoderkort.      Ændring af lov om ophavsret  (X)      Lovforslaget har som hovedformål at gennemføre EF-direktivet  om retlig beskyttelse af databaser (Europa-Parlamentet og  Rådets direktiv 96/9/EF af 11. marts 1996). Forslaget  medfører endvidere bl.a. en række ændringer af betydning for  det digitale område.      Ændring af lov om regionale kulturforsøg      Der er for perioden 1. januar 1996 til og med 31. december  1999 etableret en række regionale kulturforsøg. Det nærmere  indhold af de enkelte forsøg er fastsat i treårige  forsøgsaftaler indgået mellem kulturministeren og  forsøgsregionen. Ændringsforslaget, der indebærer, at alle  forsøgene slutter den 31. december 1999, stilles med henblik  på at give tid til en grundig evaluering af forsøgene og for,  at eventuel ny lovgivning kan træde i kraft i umiddelbar  forlængelse af afslutningen af samtlige forsøg.      Ændring af lov om Kulturfonden  (X)      Kulturfonden blev oprettet som et forsøg i 1990 og gjort  permanent i 1993. Kulturfonden har spillet en vigtig rolle  for synliggørelsen af det lokale kulturliv, og den har  etableret en frugtbar forbindelse mellem den brede, folkelige  kultur og den professionelle, etablerede kultur, men en  nyorientering synes påkrævet.       Med forslaget omdannes Kulturfonden til  Kulturministeriets Udviklingsfond. Omdannelsen sker for at  koncentrere den kulturpolitiske indsats på færre, men  banebrydende projekter af høj kvalitet, for at kunne støtte  projekter, der falder uden for de eksisterende  støtteordninger og for at kunne påtage sig en opsøgende og  igangsættende virksomhed.      Ændring af lov om statstilskud m.v. til zoologiske haver      Der er fire zoologiske haver, der modtager statstilskud i  henhold til zoo-loven: Københavns Zoologiske Have, Aalborg  Zoo, Odense Zoo og Givskud Zoo.      Lov om statstilskud m.v. til zoologiske haver påtænkes  revideret med henblik på en revision af tilskudssystemet og  en eventuel udvidelse af gyldighedsområdet. Lovrevisionen vil  endvidere tilstræbe at bringe loven i overensstemmelse med  den kommende EU-henstilling om hold af vilde dyr.      Ændring af lov om offentlige arkiver      Lovforslagets formål er primært at justere bestemmelserne om  arkivering af materiale med personoplysninger i sammenhæng  med justitsministerens revision af lovgivningen om  beskyttelse af personoplysninger.      Ændring af lov om Statens Kunstfond  (X)      Lovforslagets formål er at indføre nye stipendieordninger for  yngre skabende kunstnere samt for de skabende kunstnere i  øvrigt.      Ændring af lov om teater      Lovrevisionen vedrører Det Storkøbenhavnske Teaterfællesskab  (DST). DST-ordningen har fungeret siden 1991, og udviklingen  har vist et behov for at forbedre ordningens nuværende rammer  og indhold. Lovforslaget fremsættes nu således, at de  foreslåede ændringer kan have virkning fra år 2000, hvor de  gældende aftaler udløber.      Kulturministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Kulturpolitisk redegørelse      MILJØ- OG ENERGIMINISTEREN      Initiativer til styrkelse af indsatsen for et bedre vandmiljø      Regeringen fremlagde i september måned et udspil til  styrkelse af indsatsen for et bedre vandmiljø. Som opfølgning  vil der - ud over et forslag om en kvælstofafgift - blive  taget de nødvendige lovgivningsinitiativer.      Lovgivning om beskyttelse af det danske grundvand:      Ændring af lov om vandforsyning m.v. (Opfølgning af  Drikkevandsudvalgets arbejde)      Der blev i marts 1996 nedsat et Drikkevandsudvalg, som har  til opgave overordnet at vurdere, om det gældende lovgrundlag  sikrer en tilstrækkelig beskyttelse af grundvandet. Udvalget  vil i løbet af efteråret afgive sin endelige betænkning. Der  vil på dette grundlag blive foreslået ændringer af  lovgivningen, herunder bestemmelser, der giver mulighed for  tvungne restriktioner (ekspropriation) i særlig  nitratfølsomme områder.      Lov om forurenet jord      På baggrund af Jordforureningsudvalgets betænkning besluttede  regeringen i efteråret 1996, at forinden der fremsættes et  forslag til en samlet regulering af jordforureningsområdet,  skulle der gennemføres et analyse- og udviklingsarbejde og en  række faglige vurderinger vedrørende den praktiske  gennemførelse af en lovgivning. Dette arbejde forventes at  være færdigt i løbet af efteråret. Der vil, når resultatet af  de nævnte initiativer foreligger, blive fremlagt et samlet  lovforslag på området, bl.a. indeholdende regler om ansvar  for fremtidige forureninger.      Lovgivning om forbedringer og regelsanering af  tilskudsordninger:      Ændring af lov om miljøbeskyttelse (produktorienteret  miljøindsats)  (X)      For at styrke en produktorienteret miljøindsats foreslås en  udvidelse af de eksisterende tilskudsmuligheder på renere  teknologi- og genanvendelsesområdet. Forslaget indeholder  også bestemmelser om nedsættelse af et råd til afløsning for  det nuværende råd for renere teknologi og genanvendelse.  Endelig vil lovforslaget indeholde ændrede administrative  bestemmelser om procedurer m.v. for tilskudsforvaltning.      Lov om statstilskud til fremme af produktrettede  energibesparelser  (X)      Som led i regeringens energihandlingsplan Energi 21  fremsættes forslag om en tilskudsordning til fremme af  udstyr til energibesparelser i boliger og offentlige  institutioner. Der kan gives tilskud til udvikling,  markedsføring, anskaffelse og anvendelse af energieffektivt  og energibesparende udstyr i bygninger.      Ændring af lov om statstilskud til energibesparende  foranstaltninger i pensionisters boliger og lov om  statstilskud til omstilling af ældre boliger til kraftvarme  (X)      Der er konstateret et behov for lovændringer, der giver  mulighed for en mere fleksibel administration, herunder i  forhold til pensionister.      Lov om ophævelse af en række tilskudslove på energiområdet  (X)      Loven ophæver seks tilskudslove på energiområdet. Lovene  vedrører tilskudsordninger, der fungerede i slutningen af  1970'erne og i 1980'erne. Alle disse tilskudsordninger er  ophørt og ophæves hermed.      Ændring af lov om statstilskud til energibesparelser m.v. i  erhvervsvirksomheder      Lovforslaget åbner mulighed for, at el- og energiselskaber på  særlige betingelser kan indgå i finansieringen af  industrielle kraftvarmecentraler, uden at det medfører  nedsættelse af det investeringstilskud, der i dag kan  tildeles sådanne anlæg.      Lovgivning om affaldsbehandling:      Ændring af lov om miljøbeskyttelse (certificering af  affaldsbehandling)      Formålet med lovforslaget er at tilvejebringe hjemmel til, at  der i kommende bekendtgørelser om håndtering af affald kan  indføjes bestemmelser om, at virksomheder, der behandler  specifikke affaldstyper, skal underlægges en autorisations-  eller certificeringsordning. En sådan ordning skal sikre, at  virksomhederne etablerer og løbende vedligeholder systemer  for egenkontrol og dokumentation. Bl.a. skal lovforslaget  muliggøre en certificeringsordning i forbindelse med  etableringen af den skrotningsordning for biler, som  Miljøstyrelsen sammen med branchen arbejder på at etablere.      Ændring af lov om miljøbeskyttelse (kommunale affaldsopgaver)      Bestemmelsen i miljøbeskyttelseslovens § 49 om kommunale  fællesskaber på affaldsområdet foreslås ændret med henblik på  at ligestille kommunale fællesskaber og kommuner, således at  også kommuner kan pålægges pligt til at modtage affald fra  andre kommuner. Ændringen tager sigte på de helt særlige  situationer, hvor de kommunale myndigheder ikke kan blive  enige om en hensigtsmæssig affaldsforvaltning inden for  regionen.       Der vil endvidere blive overvejet andre lovændringer,  der er nødvendige for at sikre, at kommunerne kan leve op til  forpligtelserne på affaldsområdet.      Lovgivning om råstofforvaltning for Grønland      Som opfølgning på de igangværende forhandlinger mellem  regeringen og Grønlands hjemmestyre om overførsel af  råstofforvaltningen for Grønland til hjemmestyret forventer  regeringen at fremsætte forslag om ændring af lov om  mineralske råstoffer i Grønland samt forslag til  konsekvensændringer i en række andre love.      Lovgivning om havvindmøller      På baggrund af en kommende redegørelse om de juridiske og  økonomiske rammer for elværkernes og privates opførelse af  vindmøller på havet vil regeringen fremsætte lovforslag om,  på hvilke vilkår der kan gives tilladelse hertil.      Ændring af lov om elforsyning  (X)      Der arbejdes i øjeblikket på en omfattende revision af el- og  varmeforsyningsloven, herunder bevillingssystemet. Forslaget  herom vil imidlertid ikke kunne fremsættes i den kommende  folketingssamling. Der er derfor behov for en midlertidig  ordning for de 20 års-bevillinger, der udløber fra 1998.  Lovforslaget giver miljø- og energiministeren hjemmel til at  forlænge de nugældende bevillinger i en kortere periode på 1  - 2 år. Forslaget vil endvidere indeholde bestemmelser om, at  loven udvides til at gælde i den eksklusive økonomiske zone.      Ændring af lov om planlægning (bæredygtig planlægning i  region- og kommuneplaner, VVM-regler m.v.)      Forslaget omfatter nye bestemmelser om amters og kommuners  bidrag til tilvejebringelse af en bæredygtig udvikling i  region- og kommuneplanlægningen, supplering af VVM-reglerne,  samt andre mindre ændringer.      Folketingsbeslutning om godkendelse af Den  Afrikansk-Eurasiske Vandfugleaftale  (X)      Vandfugleaftalen er en aftale under Bonnkonventionen, som  Danmark ratificerede i 1982. Formålet med aftalen er at skabe  rammer for en samordnet beskyttelse af trækkende vandfugle.  Aftalen dækker det afrikanske og det europæiske kontinent  samt dele af Asien. Aftalen medfører ikke behov for  lovændringer.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af lov om miljøbeskyttelse (sikkerhedsstillelse)      I forlængelse af de seneste års lov og orden-initiativer vil  det blive undersøgt, hvorvidt der er mulighed for på en  afbalanceret måde at udvide bestemmelserne i  miljøbeskyttelseslovens § 39a om sikkerhedsstillelse til at  omfatte flere situationer, hvor der er risiko for, at  virksomheder påfører det offentlige store udgifter til  oprydning. Der vil blive lagt vægt på en rimelig afgrænsning  i forhold til ansvarlige virksomheder.      Miljø- og energiministeren vil give Folketinget følgende  redegørelser:      - Affaldsredegørelse  - Redegørelse om Dansk Olie og naturgas A/S  - Energipolitisk redegørelse      MINISTEREN FOR UDVIKLINGSBISTAND      Ministeren for udviklingsbistand vil give Folketinget  følgende redegørelse:      - Redegørelse om den nationale og internationale udmøntning  af »Platform for Action«, opfølgning af  Verdenskvindekonferencen i Beijing i september 1995      SKATTEMINISTEREN      Ændring af en række skattelove (reform af skatteopkrævningen)  (X)      Regeringen har besluttet at undersøge mulighederne for en  langsigtet reform af skatteopkrævningen. I den forbindelse  overvejes det at samle skattelovgivningens opkrævningsregler  i en skatteopkrævningslov.      Ændring af forskellige skatte- og afgiftslove m.v.  (Renteharmonisering)  (X)      Der foreslås bl.a. en harmonisering og forenkling af en række  bestemmelser om beregning af morarenter, rentegodtgørelser  samt procenttillæg inden for den samlede told-, afgifts- og  skattelovgivning.      Ændring af kildeskatteloven (elektronisk skattekort)  (X)      Forslaget indebærer, at alle virksomheder fra den 1. januar  1999 kan vælge at benytte elektroniske skattekortoplysninger  uden først at have modtaget de ansattes fysiske skattekort.      Ændring af en række skatte- og afgiftslove (ændrede klageveje  på afgiftsområdet m.v., klageafgift og omkostningsdækning)  (X)      Med udgangspunkt i et udvalgsarbejde overvejes det at ændre  klagereglerne på afgiftsområdet m.v., så Landsskatteretten  indsættes som 2. og sidste administrative klageinstans på en  række sagsområder. Dette indebærer, at Momsnævnet,  Motornævnet og Ankenævnet for Bidrag til  Arbejdsmarkedsfondene nedlægges. Det overvejes ligeledes at  indføre en klageafgift på alle klagesager til  Landsskatteretten og at yde omkostningsdækning i sådanne  sager.      Ændring af afskrivningsloven m.v.  (X)      Der er tale om en genfremsættelse af lovforslag, L 244 og L  245, der blev fremsat i maj 1997.       Forslagene moderniserer og forenkler regelsættet for  skattemæssige afskrivninger. Forslagene udbygges bl.a. med  forslag om afskrivningsadgang for bygninger til brug for  bondegårdsferie, jf. Indenrigsministeriets betænkning om  landdistrikterne.      Ændring af lov om arbejdsmarkedsfonde m.v.  (X)      Lovforslaget indeholder bl.a en række mindre justeringer og  præciseringer af reglerne om bidragspligt, herunder  vedrørende selvstændigt erhvervsdrivendes udenlandske  erhvervsindkomster og tilbageførsel af rentekorrektion i  bidragsgrundlaget samt bidragspligtens rækkevidde i forhold  til Grønland og Færøerne. Herudover foreslås ligningsloven  ændret således, at der i overensstemmelse med EU-retten gives  bortseelse henholdsvis fradrag for udenlandske sociale bidrag  ved opgørelsen af den skattepligtige indkomst.      Lov om ophævelse af stempelafgiftsloven (omlægning af loven  til nye afgiftslove)      Der er nedsat et udvalg, der skal vurdere muligheden for at  ophæve stempelafgiftsloven og i stedet indføre nye afgifter  til afløsning heraf. Efter kommissoriet skal udvalget stræbe  efter at færdiggøre sit arbejde med henblik på lovgivning i  folketingsåret 1997-98.      Ændring af forskellige skatte- og afgiftslove      Forslaget ændrer en række skatte- og afgiftslove -  afskrivningsloven, aktieavancebeskatningsloven,  fusionsskatteloven, selskabsskatteloven, ligningsloven,  ejendomsavancebeskatningsloven og boafgiftsloven - med  henblik på en objektivering m.v. af en række regler om  dispensationer eller tilladelser.      Ændring af skattekontrolloven og andre skatte- og afgiftslove  (husundersøgelser)  (X)      Justitsministeriet har anbefalet, at alle bestemmelser om  husundersøgelser uden retskendelse overvejes, og at sådanne  bestemmelser, hvis de fortsat er fornødne, harmoniseres.      Ændring af skattestyrelsesloven (forældelsesfrister m.v.)  (X)      På grundlag af en udtalelse fra skattelovrådet om samspillet  mellem skattestyrelseslovens fristregler og de formueretlige  forældelsesregler forventes fremsat forslag om bl.a. at  indsætte en særlig forældelsesregel for skattekrav i  skattestyrelsesloven. Forslaget forventes også at indeholde  regler om ligestilling af skattemyndighederne og skatteyderne  for så vidt angår adgangen til at inddrage nye krav under en  domstolsprøvelse af en skattesag.      Ændring af skattekontrolloven (oplysningspligt ved  transaktioner mellem koncernselskaber m.v.)  (X)      På baggrund af OECD's nye retningslinjer om vurdering af  samhandelsvilkår mellem forbundne foretagender på tværs af  grænserne - transferpricing - foreslås der regler om øget  oplysningspligt.      Ændring af realrenteafgiftsloven      Forslaget indeholder justeringer vedrørende tillægsafgiften  på obligationsafkast i datterselskaber til  livsforsikringsselskaber og pensionskasser.

Ændring af fusionsskatteloven, aktieavancebeskatningsloven og  aktieafgiftsloven      Der overvejes ændringer i fusionsskatteloven som opfølgning  på Økonomiministeriets lov om investeringsforeninger og  specialforeninger. I aktieafgiftsloven foreslås  fritagelsesbestemmelserne i fusions- og fissionstilfælde  ændret. Det overvejes endvidere at inddrage anparter under  aktieafgiften. Endelig foreslås det at harmonisere og  forenkle reglerne i aktieavancebeskatningslovens vedrørende  aktieombytning, således at reglerne bliver ens, uanset om der  er tale om aktier i selskaber inden for eller uden for EU.      Ændring af kildeskatteloven, boafgiftsloven  (X)      Der foreslås ændringer vedrørende beskatningen af ægtefællers  erhvervsvirksomhed. Der foreslås endvidere ændringer af  boafgiftslovens regler om gaver mellem ugifte samlevende.      Ændring af pensionsbeskatningsloven      Formålet med forslaget er at foretage en afgrænsning i  pensionsbeskatningsloven af ugifte samlevende, så denne  gruppe får skattemæssigt samme muligheder som ægtepar for at  få udbetalt pension, når den ene part dør.      Ændring af lov om skattefri virksomhedsomdannelse      Forslaget justerer bl.a. reglerne for interessentskaber.

Ændring af vurderingsloven  (X)      Der foreslås en række mindre justeringer i reglerne på  området bl.a. om vurderingsmænd og besigtigelse af ejendomme.      Ændring af lov om visse spil, lotteri og væddemål  (X)      Forslaget ændrer tips- og lottoloven, så Tipstjenesten får  mulighed for at etablere VLT-spil (Video Lottery Terminals).  Reglerne om tildeling af tipsmidler forventes revideret,  herunder reglerne om kredsen af modtagere og systemet for  fordelingen af tipsmidlerne. Der skal endvidere foretages  ændringer af loven, således at Grønland og Færøerne får  tildelt en forholdsmæssig andel af tipsmidlerne.      Ændring af kasinoafgiftsloven  (X)      Baggrunden for forslaget er, at de nye regler, der er  indeholdt i forlystelsesudvalgets betænkning, forudsætter nye  afgifter for »almindelige« spilleautomater. Der henvises til  justitsministerens forslag om ændring af kasinoloven.      Ændring af dødsboskatteloven m.v.

Ændring af lønsumsafgiftsloven      Kredittiden for afregning af lønsumsafgift foreslås nedsat.  For den del af lønsumsafgiften, der afregnes kvartalsvis, har  virksomhederne en kredit på 3 måneder og 15 dage med  indbetaling af afgiften. Det foreslås, at afregningstiden for  denne del af afgiften nedsættes til 15 dage.      Ændring af selskabsskatteloven (Udvidelse af  acontoskatteordningen)  (X)      Lovforslaget går ud på at udvide acontoskatteordningen  således, at alle selskaber betaler acontoskat. Udvidelsen  sker i to trin: For indkomståret 1998 skal kun selskaber og  foreninger m.v. med en skattepligtig indkomst på over 10  mill. kr. betale acontoskat. Fra og med indkomståret 1999  skal alle selskaber betale acontoskat.      Ændring af selskabsskatteloven, kildeskatteloven,  fondsbeskatningsloven og virksomhedsskatteloven  (skattefri  datterselskabsudbytter m.v.)  (X)      Der foreslås på baggrund af en dom fra EF-Domstolen at ændre  de tidsmæssige betingelser for skattefritagelse for udbytter  fra datterselskaber. Der foreslås endvidere mindre tekniske  justeringer af reglerne.      Ændring af forskellige punktafgiftslove (inflationsregulering  af visse punktafgifter m.v.)  (X)      Inflationen udhuler realværdien af visse punktafgifter,  hvilket indebærer en automatisk svækkelse af  finanspolitikken. Regeringen undersøger derfor mulighederne  for at rette op på dette, herunder at justere visse  miljøafgifter.      Ændring af lov om afgift af vejbenyttelse  (Konsekvensændringer  som følge af svensk indtræden i  systemet med den fælles vejbenyttelsesafgift)  (X)      Sverige forventes pr. 1. januar 1998 at tiltræde aftalen  mellem Beneluxlandene, Tyskland og Danmark om et fælles  system for opkrævning af vejafgift af lastbiler.

Ændring af virksomhedsskatteloven (udskudt fradrag for  driftsomkostninger)      Forslaget indebærer, at de, der benytter  virksomhedsskatteordningen, kan fremføre uudnyttede fradrag  til senere indkomstår. Forslaget er en konsekvens af  beretning af 15/5 1997 afgivet af et flertal i Folketingets  skatteudvalg til lovforslag nr. L 175 om fremførsel af  uudnyttet personfradrag.      Ændring af ligningsloven (lLempet beskatning af hæderspriser)      Forslaget har til formål at skattefritage hæderspriser, der  uddeles af mellemstatslige organisationer eller  institutioner, hvor Danmark er medlem eller deltager.      Ændring af fusionsskatteloven og skattestyrelsesloven      Der kan blive tale om ændringer af fusionsskatteloven og  skattestyrelsesloven i forbindelse med økonoministerens  lovændringer, der skal lette håndteringen af  pengeinstitutkriser.      Ændring af lov om afgift af affald og råstoffer  (X)      Det foreslås at ophæve den særlige kompensationsordning for  genanvendelsesvirksomheder, som findes i affaldsafgiftsloven.

Ændring af stempelafgiftsloven  (X)      Der indføres med virkning fra lovforslagets fremsættelse en  forhøjelse af stempelafgiften på pantebreve med pant i fast  ejendom. Forhøjelsen er midlertidig og udløber ved udgangen  af 1998. Ved udformningen sikres, at tillægsbelåning  omfattes, mens omsætningen af ejerboliger samt nybyggeriet  ikke berøres.      Skatteministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Redegørelse om medarbejderaktieordningen      SOCIALMINISTEREN      Ændring af lov om forsikring mod følger af arbejdsskade og  lov om forsikringsvirksomhed  (X)      Lovforslaget bygger på en model, efter hvilken  erhvervssygdomsområdet overdrages til en selvejende,  selvstændig institution, Arbejdsmarkedets  Erhvervssygdomssikring, administreret af ATP. Samtidig  ophæves en række særregler om arbejdsskadeforsikring i lov om  forsikringsvirksomhed. Forslaget er en opfølgning på en  betænkning fra Arbejdsskadeudvalget fra december 1994 og en  række efterfølgende udvalgsarbejder. Lovforslaget skal ses i  sammenhæng med arbejdsministerens forslag om ændring af lov  om arbejdsmiljø og forventes fremsat samtidig hermed.      Ændring af lov om børnetilskud og forskudsvis udbetaling af  børnebidrag (årlig bekræftelse af status som enlig forsørger)      For at sikre at udbetaling af børnetilskud kun sker til reelt  enlige, foreslås det, at modtagere af børnetilskud én gang  årligt skriftligt skal bekræfte fortsat status som enlig  forsørger. Kommunerne vil få hjemmel til at standse ydelsen,  såfremt der ikke modtages svar fra den pågældende.      Ændring af lov om social service (godkendelse af  opholdssteder til børn og unge)      Efter gældende regler kan børn og unge anbringes i et  opholdssted, der er godkendt af anden offentlig myndighed end  en social myndighed. Det foreslås, at det alene er de sociale  myndigheder, der har kompetencen til at godkende sådanne  opholdssteder som generelt egnede.      Ændring af lov om dagpenge ved sygdom eller fødsel  (godtgørelse til forældre med alvorligt syge børn,  forlængelse af arbejdsgiverperioden m.v.)  (X)      Forslaget medfører, at reglerne i bistandsloven om  godtgørelse til alvorligt syge overføres til  sygedagpengeloven. Med overflytningen indføres der ankeadgang  for kommunens afgørelser.      Det foreslås også, at den periode, de private arbejdsgivere  betaler sygedagpenge i, ændres fra 2 uger til 3 uger.  Samtidig får de private arbejdsgivere og frivilligt  forsikrede selvstændige erhvervsdrivende mulighed for at  vælge, om de selv vil afholde udgiften til sygedagpenge i de  to første sygedage eller betale en højere præmie til  forsikringsordningerne.       Forslaget medfører også, at forsikringsselskaberne får  pligt til at orientere skadelidtes opholdskommune, når der  udbetales erstatning til skadelidte som følge af en  personskade. Formålet er at lette kommunernes brug af  regresbestemmelsen i sygedagpengeloven.      Ændring af en række love som følge af socialreformen  (X)      Som følge af vedtagelsen af lov om social service, lov om  aktiv socialpolitik og lov om retssikkerhed og administration  på det sociale område skal der foretages en række  konsekvensændringer i Socialministeriets og andre  ministeriers lovgivning.      Ændring af lov om dagpenge ved sygdom eller fødsel og lov om  ligebehandling af mænd og kvinder med hensyn til  beskæftigelse  og barselsorlov m.v. (forlængelse af  fædreorloven til 4 uger)  (X)      Det foreslås, at den nuværende ret til fædreorlov med  dagpenge i de første 14 uger efter fødslen forlænges fra 2  uger til 4 uger.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af lov om forsikring mod følger af arbejdsskade  (regelforenkling)      For at forenkle regelsættet om arbejdsskadeforsikring  overvejes det, om arbejdsulykker, der er indtrådt før den 1.  april 1978, og erhvervssygdomme, der er anmeldt før samme  dato, i fremtiden skal behandles efter tilsvarende regler som  for sager efter 1. april 1978.      Ændring af lov om social service (regler om retssikkerheden  for personer med psykisk handicap)      Der er under Socialministeriet nedsat et udvalg om psykisk  handicappedes retssikkerhed. Arbejdet forventes afsluttet med  udgangen af 1997, og der kan på denne baggrund blive tale om  at ændre reglerne på området.      Socialministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Redegørelse om den handicappolitiske udvikling      STATSMINISTEREN      Ændring af lov om økonomisk bistand til Dagspressens  Finansieringsinstitut (nye tildelingskriterier og  tilsynsrådets sammensætning)  (X)      Forslaget er en opfølgning på Medieudvalgets betænkning om  Medierne i Demokratiet. Medieudvalget anbefalede, at der  skulle ændres på finansieringsinstituttets  tildelingskriterier og på tilsynsrådets sammensætning.      Ændring af udvalgsloven og bestyrelsesloven      Forslaget betyder, at ministeren kan undlade at besætte  medlemsposter, hvis myndigheder eller organisationer ikke  indstiller både kvinder og mænd i overensstemmelse med den  gældende lovgivning.      SUNDHEDSMINISTEREN      Ændring af lov om sundhedsvæsenets centralstyrelse m.v.  (effektivisering af patientklagesystemet)      Formålet med lovforslaget er at effektivisere og forenkle  patientklagesystemet, herunder ved at ændre nævnets  formandskab og ved at indføre en 3-årig forældelsesfrist.       Forslaget vil eventuelt indebære en ændring af den  gældende lov om embedslægeinstitutioner.      Lov om patienters retsstilling      Formålet med lovforslaget er at styrke patienters  retssikkerhed i forhold til sundhedsvæsenet og at understøtte  tillids- og fortrolighedsforholdet mellem patienterne og  sundhedsvæsenet samt dettes forskellige personalegrupper.       Med lovforslaget sker dels en styrkelse og præcisering  af patienternes retsstilling, dels en samordning af de  centrale regler om patienternes selvbestemmelse og  retssikkerhed, der allerede måtte være indeholdt i  eksisterende love eller andre regler, eventuelt  sædvanepraksis.      Ændring af lov om offentlig sygesikring      Formålet med lovforslaget er at skabe hjemmel for tilskud til  lægeordinerede ernæringspræparater for personer, der lider af  sygdom eller svækkelstilstande.      Beslutningsforslag om ratifikation af Europarådets konvention  om menneskerettigheder og biomedicin      Europarådet vedtog i november 1996 en konvention om  beskyttelse af menneskerettigheder i forbindelse med  anvendelse af biologi og lægevidenskab. Beslutningsforslaget  skal danne grundlag for, at Danmark kan ratificere  konventionen.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af lov om patientforsikring      Det overvejes at foretage en revision af den gældende  lovgivning bl.a. med henblik på at inddrage den primære  sundhedssektor.      Ændring af lov om tandpleje m.v.      Formålet med forslaget er at sikre brugerne af den særlige  amtstandpleje et relevant tandplejetilbud, herunder specielt  de tandplejetilbud, der retter sig mod tidligere  særforsorgsklienter.      Sundhedsministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Forebyggelsespolitisk redegørelse      TRAFIKMINISTEREN      Lov om buskørsel      På baggrund af Buslovudvalgets delrapport, som forventes  afgivet i efteråret 1997, vil der skulle ske ændringer i lov  om buskørsel og de tilhørende administrative regler.  Ændringerne vil hovedsagelig bestå i friere forhold for  fjernbustrafikken og en ændret sammensætning af  Persontrafikrådet.      Ændring af lov om luftfart  (X)      En ændring af lov om luftfart foreslås for at tilvejebringe  hjemmel til ratifikation af den ændrede  Eurocontrol-konvention vedrørende lufttrafikstyring.       Endvidere foreslås i lyset af den internationale  udvikling på området en nedsættelse af promillegrænsen fra  0,4 til 0,2 promille for personer, der gør tjeneste i et  luftfartøj.      Ændring af lov om anlæg af fast forbindelse over Storebælt  (X)      Der søges tilvejebragt hjemmel til opkrævning af en  kontrolafgift for bilister, der unddrager sig betaling ved  passage af motorvejsforbindelsen.      Ændring af lov om anlæg af fast forbindelse over Øresund  (X)      Lovforslaget indebærer i lighed med ændring af lov om anlæg  af Storebælt i efteråret 1996, at Banestyrelsen bliver  infrastrukturforvalter for landanlæggenes jernbanedel.  Lovforslaget vil endvidere give trafikministeren bemyndigelse  til at fastsætte betaling for benyttelse af jernbanen.      Lov om jernbanevirksomhed  (X)      Som følge af opdelingen af jernbanedriften i en operatør- og  infrastrukturejerside fremsættes der forslag til lov om  jernbanevirksomhed. Lovforslaget skal regulere åbningen af  skinnenettet for konkurrence samt give hjemmel til, at der  kan opkræves betaling for kørsel på skinnenettet. Der vil  endvidere blive skabt hjemmel til, at trafikministeren kan  implementere fremtidige EU-retsakter vedrørende  jernbanedrift.      Lov om etablering af den selvstændige offentlig virksomhed  DSB m.v.      Der blev den 24. oktober 1996 indgået en supplementsaftale  til DSB-rammeaftalen af november 1994. Som udmøntning af  aftalen fremsættes lovforslag om, at DSB den 1. januar 1999  etableres som en selvstændig offentlig virksomhed, jf. Post  Danmark modellen, og at der under den selvstændige offentlige  virksomhed kan etableres de i aftalen forudsatte  datterselskaber.      Lov om visse hovedlandevejsstrækninger      Lovforslaget forventes bl.a. at omfatte ophævelse og ændring  af en række projekterings- og anlægsbemyndigelser vedrørende  hovedlandevejsnettet. Forslaget er delvis en opfølgning på  den i sidste folketingssamling vedtagne ændring af vejloven,  der bl.a. indebærer, at 2/3 af statsvejnettet overføres til  amterne pr. 1. januar 1998.      Ændring af godskørselsloven og ændring af færdselsloven  (X)      På baggrund af en rapport om lastbilers og bussers  trafiksikkerhed fremsættes der forslag til ændring af  godskørselsloven med henblik på at indføre skærpede  sanktionsmuligheder, herunder tilbageholdelse af køretøjer i  forbindelse med alvorlige overtrædelser af loven samt i  gentagelsestilfælde konfiskation af lastbiler. Der vil  endvidere blive foreslået nye tiltag på kontrol- og  sanktionsområdet, herunder opprioritering af  tungvognskontrollen og skærpede sanktioner for overtrædelse  af køre-hviletidsbestemmelserne, ikke mindst i  gentagelsestilfælde.       Det overvejes endelig at foretage ændringer i  færdselsloven ligeledes med henblik på at øge  trafiksikkerheden for store vogne. Herudover kan mindre  ændringer af færdselsloven komme  på tale.      Ændring af lov om fremgangsmåde ved ekspropriation vedrørende  fast ejendom og ændring af lov om offentlige veje og lov om  private fællesvej      Lovforslaget vedrører ændrede regler om fremgangsmåden ved  ekspropriation og særlige regler om information af borgerne  ved større anlægsprojekter. Der kan endvidere blive tale om  ændring af vejlovenes bestemmelser om klageadgang, således at  visse beslutninger først kan iværksættes efter klagefristens  udløb.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Lov om anlæg af jernbanestrækninger mellem Eriknauer og  Horsens og mellem Horsens og Skanderborg      Som forudsat i projekteringsloven om udretning af  jernbanestrækningen fra Eriknauer til Horsens og fra Horsens  til Skanderborg vil der, når den igangværende offentlige  høring m.v. er afsluttet, blive fremsat forslag til  anlægslov, såfremt  »udretningsløsningen« vælges.  Lovforslaget vil i givet fald indebære, at rejsetiden med tog  mellem Århus og Fredericia forkortes, og at banens kapacitet  forøges.      Lov om ændring af statshavnestrukturen      Der overvejes ændringer af den fremtidige statshavnestruktur,  herunder af ejerskabsforholdet for statshavnene.      Trafikministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Trafikpolitisk redegørelse      UDENRIGSMINISTEREN      Lov om Danmarks tiltrædelse af Amsterdamtraktaten  (X)      Lovforslaget vil indeholde de bestemmelser, der vil danne  grundlag for dansk tiltrædelse af Amsterdamtraktaten.       Lovforslaget vil indebære, at Danmark kan tiltræde  Amsterdamtraktaten, der er resultatet af EU's  regeringskonference i 1996-97. Amsterdamtraktaten vil efter  ratifikation i medlemslandene ændre Den Europæiske  Unions traktatgrundlag.      Lov om gennemførelse af aftale med Partnerskab for Fred-lande  om militære styrkers juridiske status (PfP status of Forces  Agreement (PfP-SOFA)) med tillægsprotokol      NATO-landene indgik i 1951 en Status of Forces Agreement  (NATO-SOFA) om militære styrkers juridiske status i  forbindelse med ophold i andre NATO-lande. Med henblik på  aktiviteter inden for Partnerskab for Fred (PfP) har  NATO-kredsen udarbejdet en PfP-SOFA.       PfP-SOFA'en forudses tiltrådt af NATO-landene og  PfP-landene. NATO-SOFA'ens geografiske anvendelsesområde vil  hermed blive udstrakt til PfP-landene. Det nærmere omfang af  følgelovgivning er endnu ikke fastlagt.       Danmarks engagement i militært samarbejde også uden for  en NATO- eller PfP-ramme, f.eks. samarbejdet om  »Multinational United Nations Stand-By Forces High Readiness  Brigade« (SHIRBRIG), er stigende. Der sigtes derfor mod, at  NATO-SOFA'ens regler også vil kunne anvendes uden for NATO og  PfP-sammenhæng.      Folketingsbeslutning om Danmarks ratifikation af De Forenede  Nationers konvention om et omfattende atomprøvestop      Traktaten om et omfattende atomprøvestop blev vedtaget af  FN's 51. generalforsamling den 10. september 1996 og åbnet  for underskrift den 24. september samme år. Danmark var  blandt de første underskrivere. Danmark ønsker ligeledes at  være blandt de første til at ratificere.       I tilknytning til traktaten oprettes en organisation,  hvis formål det er at tilse, at traktaten efterleves. Et  globalt overvågningssystem bestående af 321 forudsete  målestationer udgør sammen med retten til internationale  inspektioner og kontrol grundelementet i traktatens  verifikationssystem. To målestationer placeres i Danmark  (Grønland).      Folketingsbeslutning om Danmarks ratifikation af protokoller  om Polens, Ungarns og Den Tjekkiske Republiks tiltrædelse af  Den Nordatlantiske Traktat      Protokollerne om Polens, Ungarns og Den Tjekkiske Republiks  tiltrædelse af Den Nordatlantiske Traktat forventes  undertegnet i december 1997.      Folketingsbeslutning om Danmarks tiltrædelse af partnerskabs-  og samarbejdsaftalerne om oprettelse af et partnerskab  mellem De Europæiske Fællesskaber og deres medlemsstater  på den ene side og henholdsvis Armenien, Aserbajdjan,  Georgien og Usbekistan på den anden side  (X)      Folketingsbeslutning om Danmarks tiltrædelse af rammeaftalen  af 28. oktober 1996 om handel og samarbejde mellem det  Europæiske Fællesskab og dets medlemsstater på den ene side  og Republikken Korea på den anden side  (X)      Folketingsbeslutning om samtykke til Danmarks ratifikation  af den konvention om totalforbud mod personelminer, som  ventes undertegnet i Ottawa i december 1997      Formålet med konventionen er at forhindre anvendelse af  personelminer i fremtidige konflikter, både internationale  og interne. Konventionen vil forbyde produktion, oplagring,  eksport og anvendelse af personelminer. Konventionen  forventes færdigforhandlet på en konference i Oslo i  september 1997. Forslaget søger at sikre, at Danmark bliver  et af de første lande til at ratificere konventionen.      Folketingsbeslutning om Danmarks ratifikation af Det  Europæiske Charter for Regional- eller Mindretalssprog      Det Europæiske Charter har til formål at beskytte og styrke  anvendelsen af regional- eller mindretalssprog som en vigtig  del af Europas kulturarv.       Charteret indebærer en forpligtelse for deltagerlandene  til at fjerne enhver form for diskrimination på grund af  sprog og til at fremme anvendelse af regional- eller  mindretalssprog i uddannelsessystemet, i relation til  offentlige administrative myndigheder og domstolene, i  medierne samt i kultur- og samfundslivet i øvrigt, herunder  det økonomiske og sociale liv.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Lov om udvidelse af Danmarks søterritorium      Forslaget tilsigter en udvidelse af Danmarks søterritorium  fra de nuværende 3 sømil indtil 12 sømil med mulighed for  tilsvarende udvidelse omkring Grønland og Færøerne. En  udvidelse af Danmarks søterritorium betyder en øget  geografisk udstrækning af Danmarks højhedsret - suverænitet -  og dermed almene jurisdiktionskompetence. Hermed åbnes for  fastsættelse og håndhævelse af danske regler - både  offentligretlige regler, herunder straffeloven, og  privatretlige regler - på et større geografisk område end  hidtil.      UNDERVISNINGSMINISTEREN      Lov om korte videregående uddannelser  (X)      Loven skal skabe rammer for fornyelse og udvikling af korte  videregående uddannelser for unge og voksne med en  grundlæggende erhvervsuddannelse. Uddannelserne skal også  være attraktive og relevante for gymnasialt uddannede. Loven  skal afløse lov om videregående teknikeruddannelser, men  omfatter et langt bredere uddannelses- og beskæftigelsesfelt  end denne lov.      Ændring af lov om statens uddannelsesstøtte (Ph.d. m.v.)  (X)      Forslaget indeholder ændringer som følge af en kommende  aftale mellem Finansministeriet og Akademikernes  Centralorganisation om lønnede Ph.d.-stipendiater. Endvidere  foreslås andre mindre justeringer af loven.      Ændring af lov om Arbejdsgivernes Elevrefusion      Lovforslaget indebærer en besparelse pr. 1. januar 1998 i  statens tilskud til AER vedrørende udgifterne til elever  under skolepraktik. Endvidere foreslås, at staten fremover  overtager finansieringen af skolehjemsudgifter for elever  under skoleundervisning i henhold til lov om  erhvervsuddannelser.      Ændring af lov om friskoler og private grundskoler m.v.  (Tilsyn)      Tilsynsbestemmelserne foreslås ændret bl.a. således, at det  bliver muligt for undervisningsministeren at pålægge  kommunerne at føre fagligt tilsyn med en fri grundskole.      Ændring af lov om folkeskolen      Forslaget vedrører undervisningspligtens opfyldelse på  sociale institutioner og forsøgs- og udviklingsarbejder i  indskolingsforløbet.      Ændring af en række love på uddannelsesområdet      Forslaget vil indeholde en afklaring vedrørende vilkårene for  betaling i forbindelse med lejrskoler m.v.      Ændring af lov om folkehøjskoler, efterskoler,  husholdningsskoler og håndarbejdsskoler  (X)      Der genindføres en obligatorisk kommunal elevstøtte til  elever under 18 år ved ungdomshøjskoler svarende til  ordningen for elever ved efterskoler og husholdningsskoler.  Støtten bortfaldt i forbindelse med omlægningen af elevstøtte  til driftstilskud for folkehøjskoler, men virkningerne for  ungdomshøjskolerne har været kraftige.      Ændring af lov om daghøjskoler og produktionsskoler m.v.  (Skoleledelse, grundtilskud, kvaliteten af tilbudet m.v.)      I lighed med hvad der er indført for andre selvejende  institutioner, vil der blive foreslået klarere regler for  skolelederens adgang til at lede andre institutioner.  Endvidere er der behov for en sikring af skolernes lokale  forankring bl.a. gennem regulering af adgangen til at  gennemføre aktivitet i kommuner, der ikke yder grundtilskud.  Endelig er der behov for sikring af daghøjskolernes  skolemiljø og kvaliteten af deres tilbud. For  produktionsskolerne foreslås en permanent hjemmel til at yde  godtgørelse for befordringsudgifter.      Der vil eventuelt blive fremsat følgende forslag:      Ændring af lov om almen voksenuddannelse (klageregler, tilsyn  med prøver m.v.)      Forslaget indeholder regler om klageadgang og tilsyn med  prøver, niveaudeling af undervisningen og fastsættelse af  bestemmelserne om formålet og tilrettelæggelsen af  undervisningen i de enkelte fag.      Lovgivning om elevers og studerendes medbestemmelse og  demokratiske indflydelse i uddannelsessystemet      Der overvejes en opfølgning på redegørelsen om demokrati i  uddannelserne. Formålet er at sikre bedre vilkår for elevers  og studerendes medbestemmelse på uddannelsesinstitutionerne  og inddragelse i den overordnede uddannelsespolitiske  rådgivning. Hensigten er endvidere at skabe større sammenhæng  i vilkårene for medbestemmelse op gennem uddannelsessystemet.      Lovgivning om et videreuddannelsessystem for voksne      Der overvejes en rammelov for fire nye kompetenceniveauer  (GVU, VVU, Diplom og Master). Titlerne kan opnås ved at  gennemføre indholdsregulerede forløb eller frie uddannelser,  som kan kombineres fra et bredt udvalg af  voksenuddannelsestilbud. Videreuddannelsessystemet bygges op  som et pointsystem, som sigter mod at give voksne mulighed  for at udvikle deres jobkompetence gennem hele arbejdslivet.      Undervisningsministeren vil give Folketinget følgende  redegørelser:      - Redegørelse om demokrati i uddannelserne  - Redegørelse om højskolernes situation  - Redegørelse om merit og fleksibiliteten i de videregående  uddannelser  - Redegørelse om institutionsstruktur på de videregående  uddannelser  - Redegørelse om uddannelser og erhvervsliv  - Redegørelse om uddannelses- og erhvervsvejledning      ØKONOMIMINISTEREN      Ændring af lov om banker og sparekasser m.v., lov om  forsikringsvirksomhed, realkreditloven, lov om  værdipapirhandel m.v. og lov om fondsmæglerselskaber m.fl.  (Ændring af tavshedspligts- og partsbegrebsbestemmelserne  samt forenkling af lovene m.v.)      Der foreslås en række præciseringer og tilpasninger af  bestemmelserne om tavshedspligt og partsbegreb. Desuden  foreslås ændringer for at sikre en ensartet regulering af  koncernforhold og ændringer af reglerne om forvaltningen af  og rådgivning om langsigtet opsparing. Der foreslås endvidere  ændringer for at lette håndtering af pengeinstitutkriser,  ændringer som led i den generelle regelforenkling og  konsekvensændringer som følge af ØMU'en.      Lov om pensionsmæssige forhold for mænd og kvinder  (X)      Forslaget implementerer direktiv 86/378/EØF af 24. juli 1986  som ændret den 2. december 1996 om gennemførelse af  princippet om ligebehandling af mænd og kvinder inden for de  erhvervstilknyttede sociale sikringsordninger.      Lov om investorgarantiordninger      Forslaget implementerer direktiv om en investorgarantiordning  af 17. februar 1997. Loven vil give investorer i  investeringsservicevirksomheder - fondsmæglerselskaber og  pengeinstitutter - en beskyttelse, der svarer til den  beskyttelse, som indskydere i pengeinstitutter har i medfør  af indskudsgarantidirektivet. Forslaget vil betyde en større  sikkerhed for de pågældende investorer og kan dermed have  positive erhvervsmæssige konsekvenser.      Økonomiministeren vil give Folketinget følgende redegørelse:      - Redegørelse om den finansielle sektor",

         "Vi står over for en meget afgørende folketingssamling. Vi  skal have to valg og en vigtig folkeafstemning. Det er en  folketingssamling, som vil kræve en stor ansvarlighed af alle  Folketingets partier.       Der er nogle, der i dag har skrevet, at dagens debat  skulle blive en gyser. Det er jo ikke til at sige. I min  optik kræver det, at man får en gyser, også, at der er mindst  én skurk, og når jeg ser ud over denne pæne forsamling af  herrer og damer, er det svært at se, hvem skurken eventuelt  skulle være. Men der kan selvfølgelig - specielt måske på min  højre side - være én eller to, som er i en god forklædning.       Åbningstalen, som statsministeren holdt i tirsdags,  synes jeg var en rigtig god åbningstale. Det er der også  andre, der har syntes. I de 16 år, jeg har været medlem af  Folketinget, har jeg ikke oplevet en åbningstale, der ikke er  blevet karakteriseret enten som alt for slap eller som alt  for ideologisk. Ingen af de to karakteristikker er givet af  åbningstalen. Det synes jeg er et godt tegn.       Vi står også med mange gode tegn. Vi står med et land og  et samfund, der er i fremgang. Resultaterne siden 1993 er  mange og markante. Den almindelige dansker er langt bedre  stillet i dag end for bare få år siden. Jeg læste i går, at  vi har en beskæftigelse her i landet, der er den højeste  nogen sinde, og vi har et fald i ledigheden, der kan  registreres hver eneste dag, ikke mindst med hensyn til de  unge, men også til mennesker, der har været ledige meget  længe.       Vi er også i en situation, hvor vi har fået vendt  udviklingen i de offentlige udgifter. Hvor det igennem  1980'erne var sådan, at udgifterne til overførselsindkomster  og til passiv forsørgelse steg år for år, er det nu sådan, at  dér, hvor de offentlige udgifter stiger, og dér, hvor vi  bruger penge i det offentlige, er på de kommunale  serviceområder: Det er til de ældre, til de syge, til  børnepasning og til folkeskolen. Det er en god udvikling også  for de offentlige udgifter.       Vi har også uddannelsesmuligheder for de unge som aldrig  før. 8 ud af 10 gennemfører en ungdomsuddannelse, og vi har  nu så mange pladser på vores videregående uddannelser som  aldrig før. Optaget sætter rekord år for år.       Miljøindsatsen har fået den rigtige høje prioritet, som  den bør have. Der er virkelig sket et tiltrængt kvalitetsløft  i vores velfærdssamfund. Vi har fået en bedre service, og vi  har fået bedre levevilkår.  Det er naturligvis ikke skabt af ingenting. Det er skabt  af, at der er en politisk vilje og har været en politisk  vilje til den udvikling, og så er det samtidig muliggjort af,  at der har været en meget bevidst tilrettelagt økonomisk  politik, som har bragt Danmark op i den absolutte økonomiske  elite i Europa; og det er jo dér, vi gerne skulle blive.  Lige nu er forbrugsvæksten lidt for stor. Derfor er det  nødvendigt at dæmpe tempoet og øge opsparingen. Regeringen  viser rettidig omhu ved nu at fremlægge sit udspil, et  udspil, der er ubureaukratisk, og som har en god social  profil. Det er en ekstraordinær pensionsopsparing på 1 pct.  til ATP i 1998, en midlertidig forhøjelse af stempelafgiften  på tillægslån og statslige besparelser på 2 mia. kr.  Hvordan er det så blevet karakteriseret? Jo,  Nationalbanken brugte udtrykket passende. Jeg så i  Jyllands-Postens leder i dag - det er ellers ikke det organ,  som regeringen normalt roses mest i - at det var moderat og  spiseligt, og mange økonomer har ligefrem kaldt det  effektivt.  Jeg tror, det er et rigtig godt udspil, der er kommet  fra regeringen, et udspil, hvor vi dæmper uden at sætte i  stå. Sporene fra V's og K's kartoffelkur for ti år siden  skræmmer. Der bliver nu sendt et signal til befolkningen om  at holde igen med forbrug.  Situationen vil kræve ansvarlighed af os alle, og  eventuelle skeptikere over for det udspil, regeringen er  kommet med, skylder os og offentligheden at besvare to  spørgsmål.  For det første: Mener man ikke, at der er behov for en  dæmpning af forbruget? Hvis man svarer ja til det, skylder  man os, og man skylder borgerne et meget klart svar på,  hvilken alternativ løsning man vil pege på, som har den samme  effekt på betalingsbalancen, altså det samme mål, og som er  lige så ubureaukratisk og socialt afbalanceret som det,  regeringen har spillet ud med.  For det andet er det ikke nok at sige, at man vil  forhandle. Man er i øjeblikket lige ved at falde over  hinanden for at forhandle. Det er ikke nok. Vi må have noget  mere kød på, og jeg synes, vi må have noget mere kød på i  dag. Lad os få nogle svar. Hvad er det for nogle bud, man  har? Regeringspartierne har spillet ud med et godt udspil. Nu  vil vi høre, hvad oppositionen ønsker.  Arbejdsmarkedsreformerne har haft en meget positiv  virkning på beskæftigelsesudviklingen. Der er sket et  historisk fald i ledigheden, uden at det har skabt  flaskehalsproblemer, og det fjerde punkt i regeringens udspil  er netop arbejdsmarkedsområdet, en tilpasning, som yderligere  skal skabe mobilitet og fleksibilitet på arbejdsmarkedet,  således at vi også fremover kan forebygge  flaskehalsproblemer. Afskaffelse af deltagerbetalingen på  AMU-kurser vil sammen med de andre forslag yde et positivt  bidrag til denne forebyggelse og i øvrigt være en velkommen  administrativ lettelse for virksomhederne: mindre  administrativt bøvl.  Der er brug for et tæt samspil mellem regeringen og  arbejdsmarkedets parter om udviklingen af et rummeligt  arbejdsmarked, hvor der er plads til mennesker med nedsat  arbejdsevne. Dem, der i 1980'erne blev sendt på  førtidspension, skal vi have plads til på arbejdsmarkedet, og  der skal også være plads til de ældre i arbejdsstyrken, som  har lyst til og mulighed for at blive lidt længere.  Til et smidigt arbejdsmarked hører også, at  børnefamilierne kan få arbejdslivet og tiden sammen med deres  børn til at gå op i en højere enhed, og derfor vil jeg gerne  udtrykke en støtte til regeringens og flere forbunds forslag  om at forlænge barselorloven for fædre og om en mere  fleksibel børnepasningsorlov. Det synes jeg er forslag i den  rigtige retning.  Folkeskolen har været igennem en turbulent periode. Vi  tager børnenes fremtid og folkeskolens udvikling alvorligt,  men jeg må nok sige, at den kritik, der ofte fremføres, efter  min mening er en uskøn blanding af uanvendelige  internationale sammenligninger, nogle politikeres ønske om at  genindføre terpe- og sorteringsskolen og en hæmningsløs  nedrakning af folkeskolen og dens lærere fra specielt  konservativ side.  Jeg synes, det er helt urimeligt. Vi har en god  folkeskolelov, som kræver, at eleverne skal have færdigheder  og kundskaber, men som også kræver, at skolen skal  understøtte børnenes personlige og sociale udvikling. Det er  kommunernes og skolernes opgave at leve op til de krav. Den  opgave løses på de fleste skoler langt bedre, end den  politiske debat her i huset giver indtryk af, men der kan da  selvfølgelig peges på forhold, der kan gøres bedre.           Vi vil endvidere godt pege på, at vi synes, man kan  lægge mere undervisning ind i børnehaveklassen for at  forberede starten på den egentlige skolegang. Vi vil også  gerne være med til at øge antallet af timer i dansk og  matematik i de små klasser, og vi vil gerne være med til at  bruge flere midler på nye og bedre undervisningsmaterialer og  på den informationsteknologi, der er nødvendig ude i  skolerne.       Sygehusbehandling og de sindslidendes forhold har nu  fået den høje prioritet, som de områder bør have. I årene op  til 1992 blev bevillingerne år for år sat ned. Fra 1993 har  der været en vækst i sygehusenes udgifter, og der er blevet  gjort en meget betydelig ekstra indsats i forhold til de  sindslidende. Der har været et godt samarbejde imellem stat,  amter og kommuner om denne opgave:       Der bliver nu uddannet det nødvendige personale, mange  flere mennesker bliver behandlet, ventetiden er betydeligt  afkortet på en række behandlinger, informationen til  patienterne er blevet meget bedre, og med det nye  tidsbestillingssystem til forundersøgelse og operation - det  såkaldte bookingsystem - vil man få mulighed for at lave en  meget bedre arbejdstilrettelæggelse på sygehusene, hvilket  yderligere kan nedbringe ventetiden.       De sindslidendes forhold forbedres år for år gennem en  meget bevidst politisk prioritering, og vi ser også meget  frem til en ny samlet lovgivning om patienternes rettigheder.  Jo, sygehusbehandling - behandling af syge mennesker - og  forbedring af de sindslidendes forhold har fået den høje  prioritet, det fortjener. Også i aftalen om amternes økonomi  i 1998 er denne prioritering på sygehusområdet og for en  forbedring af de psykisk syges forhold blevet fastholdt.  Retspolitik har jo en central plads i den politiske  debat. Vi er selvfølgelig alle sammen optaget af at opnå den  mest effektive kriminalitetsbekæmpelse, både når det drejer  sig om hurtig efterforskning, og når det drejer sig om  følelige sanktioner, når forbrydelserne er begået, og vi  sætter selvfølgelig med tilsvarende vægt ind med effektive  forebyggende foranstaltninger.  Politiets synlighed og servicen over for borgerne  spiller en helt afgørende rolle for borgernes tryghed. Det er  vigtigt, at politiet tager sig af det, når folk har brug for  hjælp, f.eks. efter et indbrud. Og derfor er det i en tid,  hvor politiet også må bruge ekstraordinært mange kræfter på  rockerkriminalitet, gadebandekriminalitet og illegal  menneskesmugling, helt relevant hele tiden at drøfte og følge  med i, om politiet har de nødvendige ressourcer til at løse  alle opgaverne, også de opgaver, der drejer sig om servicen  over for den enkelte borger.  Derfor vil vi gerne være med til diskutere de spørgsmål  med forligsparterne. Vi er klar til at tilføre politiet og  anklagemyndigheden de yderligere målrettede ressourcer, der  måtte være behov for, men naturligvis på en sådan måde, at  politiforligets krav om modernisering og effektivisering i  politiet samtidig gennemføres.  På miljøområdet er vi fast besluttet på, at de  opstillede målsætninger skal nås. Det gælder også i forhold  til vandmiljøet. Her har holdningen over for landbruget været  alt for slap. Det er ikke vejret, det er heller ikke Rhinen,  men landbrugets kvælstofudledning, der er hovedskurken for  iltsvindet i de indre farvande.  Der må tages helt anderledes fat på det spørgsmål. Vi  vil støtte skærpede regler for gødskning, en bedre kontrol,  en maksimal udnyttelse af naturens egne kræfter, og som noget  helt nødvendigt vil vi også støtte økonomiske  styringsinstrumenter, nemlig en kvælstofafgift, sådan som det  også blev anbefalet ikke bare af miljøministeren, men også af  overvismanden. Hvis jeg må have lov at citere overvismanden,  der sagde, at grønne afgifter er det mest effektive  styringsinstrument over for landbruget! Jeg er 100 pct. enig  i det synspunkt.       I skærende kontrast til det synspunkt står  landbrugsorganisationernes reaktion og Venstres og De  Konservatives finanslovudspil kemisk renset for afgifter som  styringsredskab, altså ligegyldighed over for vandmiljøet for  at tilfredsstille landbrugslobbyens høge. Men rent drikkevand  er et selvfølgeligt mål i vores miljøpolitik. Regeringen har  igennem de sidste 5 år systematisk arbejdet med opgaven, og  meget er gjort. Desværre er det også her alt sammen  initiativer, som V og K ikke har kunnet støtte.  Men de to partier får en chance igen, for der skal gøres  endnu mere: Vi skal have ryddet op efter fortidens synder,  forbruget af sprøjtegifte må bringes ned ved en markant  forhøjelse af pesticidafgiften og ved en mere systematisk  fremme af økologisk landbrug, og store svinefarme hører nu  engang ikke hjemme i drikkevandsområder.  Der er ingen tvivl om, at flygtninge- og  indvandrerspørgsmål med rette optager mange borgere, og  derfor er det også vigtigt, at vi diskuterer disse spørgsmål.  Socialdemokratiets udlændingepolitik bygger på humanisme og  konsekvens. Vi er klar til at yde beskyttelse af de  mennesker, der må flygte fra forfølgelse i deres hjemland.  Vi ønsker også at føre en familiepolitik, der betyder,  at når en udlænding er godkendt til ophold her i landet, så  skal vedkommende have mulighed for at leve sammen med sin  ægtefælle og sine mindreårige børn. Jeg troede sådan set  også, at det var god liberal og konservativ familiepolitik,  at familierne kan bo sammen.  Det tredje, jeg vil sige, er, at udlændinge, der har  fået permanent opholdstilladelse her i landet, naturligvis  også skal behandles som danske borgere i tilsvarende  situationer.  Og endelig vil jeg sige - og det er det fjerde element i  vores udlændingepolitik - at vi ikke accepterer svindel. Vi  ønsker ikke at acceptere en illegal indvandring, og vi  accepterer ikke, at man misbruger dansk gæstfrihed til grov  kriminalitet. Vi ønsker, at retshåndhævelsen på de punkter  skal være konsekvent, og derfor vil jeg godt udtrykke min  støtte til indenrigsministerens arbejde med netop at slå ned  for at få afdækket denne svindel og til arbejdet med at  skærpe udvisningsreglerne.  Der skal også lyde en utvetydig støtte til en samlet  integrationslov med klare rettigheder og pligter, en  integration i det danske samfund, hvor adgang til permanent  opholdstilladelse i Danmark er kædet sammen med, at den  pågældende udlænding aktivt deltager i integrationsprocessen.  Når vi opstiller de krav, så kræver det jo til gengæld, at vi  også lever op til vore pligter, nemlig at de relevante tilbud  om integration skal være til stede. Og det kræver naturligvis  også, at den enkeltes retssikkerhed ikke tilsidesættes i en  sådan ny integrationsordning.  De tosprogede børn skal kunne tale og forstå dansk, når  de starter i skolen. I de kommuner, hvor man på det punkt gør  en opsøgende indsats i forhold til vrangvillige forældre, har  man faktisk god erfaring med det. Der er en meget, meget  positiv effekt, hvis kommunerne selv opsøger og sørger for,  at børnene lærer og forstår dansk, inden de starter i skolen.  Jeg vil også godt sige, at jeg synes, vi danskere har en  forpligtelse til at modarbejde tendenser til diskrimination i  vores samfund. Det gælder på arbejdsmarkedet, og det gælder i  mange andre dagligdags situationer. Og når jeg siger det, er  det også, fordi debatten ofte efter min mening foregår på et  lavt og nedrigt niveau; et niveau, som legitimerer fremmedhad  og diskrimination. Debatten tager typisk udgangspunkt i  enkeltsager, hvor nogen forsøger at udnytte systemet, og  næsten aldrig i de 95 pct. af indvandrere og flygtninge, som  lever en stille og rolig tilværelse i vores samfund.  Selv medlemmer af Folketinget deltager i debatten og  efter min mening på et nedrigt niveau. Jeg tænker her på hr.  Tom Behnke, som foreslog at smide afviste asylsøgere ud med  faldskærm over deres hjemland. Men jeg tænker også på fru  Inge Dahl-Sørensen fra Venstre, der i tv i sidste uge gik ind  for, at nu skulle Danmark starte en lejrkultur og etablere  lejre i Saharaørkenen, hvor vi kunne sende asylsøgerne ned.  Det er efter min mening afstumpet til det skræmmende.  Jeg synes næsten ikke, at der kan bruges for stærke ord. Det  er afstumpet til det skræmmende. Jeg synes, det er pinligt,  at folketingsmedlemmer deltager i en debat på det niveau, og  man kunne have lyst til at spørge: Dækker det virkelig  Venstres holdning? Jeg vil nægte at tro det, i hvert fald  indtil videre.  Til sidst vil jeg gerne sige et par ord om  Amsterdamtraktaten, hvor der for Socialdemokratiet er tre  grunde til, at vi siger ja:  Med traktaten er der skabt en enestående mulighed for at  få flere lande med i et forpligtende samarbejde. Det er  vigtigt for freden og sikkerheden i vor del af verden, det  understøtter opbygningen af demokratiet i de nye lande, og  det er afgørende for såvel deres som vores velfærdsudvikling.  Udvidelsens perspektiv er i sig selv nok til et ja til  Amsterdamtraktaten.  Dertil kommer jo, at traktaten på en række afgørende  punkter er bedre end det nuværende traktatgrundlag. Det  gælder miljøet, beskæftigelsen, forbrugerbeskyttelsen,  respekt for menneskerettigheder, bekæmpelse af svig, større  åbenhed, og det er ikke mindst gennem en dansk indsats, at  disse klare forbedringer er kommet med.  Og den tredje grund drejer sig om forbeholdene, for er  de opretholdt, sådan som det blev lovet? Ja, jeg tror, jeg  vil nøjes med at citere professor Hjalte Rasmussen, der for  nylig udtrykte det om forbeholdene på følgende måde, idet han  sagde, at vi ikke har tabt en eneste sten på gulvet i  forhandlingerne om Amsterdamtraktaten; tværtimod er det  lykkedes at gå fra en juridisk hybrid og til god, gedigen  traktattekst. Jeg tror ikke, det kan udtrykkes ret meget  klarere.  Folkeafstemningen kommer den 28. maj næste år. Der er  lang tid til, men vi ved jo alle sammen, hvorfor der går så  lang tid. Det er mit ønske og håb, at debatten frem til  afstemningen må blive åben og reel, og at den frem for alt må  basere sig på faktiske forhold og ikke på myter.  Det samme håber jeg om den forestående  folketingssamling, og det gælder også den helt aktuelle debat  om justering af omsvinget, som jo finder sted i dag og i de  kommende dage. Jeg håber, at også den debat må foregå på et  seriøst grundlag, og at partier både til højre og til venstre  for regeringen er parat til at tage ansvar, når det kommer  til stykket, i stedet for at forfalde til almindelig  populisme.  Efter de første reaktioner har alle nu haft lejlighed  til at sove på det. Alle har haft lejlighed til at besinde  sig, og heldigvis har vi det jo sådan, at åbningstalen er om  tirsdagen og debatten om torsdagen, så der er tid til at  tænke sig om. Jeg håber, at denne besindelse også vil komme  til at præge debatten i dag.",

         "Først vil jeg gerne sige til hr. Frank Aaen, at jeg synes,  man med rette kan sige, at det udspil, der er kommet om  ATP-ordningen - denne ekstra opsparing, der her bliver tale  om - er socialt afbalanceret. Jeg synes, der er en god social  profil i den ordning, og jeg tror, der er en pointe i, at vi  alle sammen skal yde et bidrag. Men der er til gengæld også  en pointe i, at vi yder et bidrag i forhold til vores  indkomst, bortset fra pensionister og efterlønsmodtagere, som  slet ikke er med i ordningen. Kontanthjælpsmodtagere og  dagpengemodtagere indbetaler netto ca. 50 kr. om måneden, og  folk, der har en meget stor indkomst, betaler 1 pct. af deres  samlede bruttoindkomst. Men til gengæld - det er jo ikke  nogen skat, det er jo en opsparing - får netop de allerlavest  lønnede fuld valuta og meget mere til på  udbetalingstidspunktet, så jeg synes, der er en god social  profil.       Så vil jeg sige til fru Pia Kjærsgaard, at det er en god  idé at kigge i lovkataloget, for dér står en lang række ting  om initiativer på udlændingeområdet. Og det samme vil jeg  sige til hr. Kristian Thulesen Dahl, som må have skrevet sin  korte bemærkning, inden debatten startede, og inden hr.  Thulesen Dahl havde hørt mit indlæg. Man kan da ikke påstå,  at jeg ikke gjorde noget ud af indvandrer- og  flygtningeområdet. Det kan godt være, det ikke var det første  punkt, jeg havde med i min tale, men det var til gengæld et  ganske langt punkt, fordi vi synes, det er et vigtigt  spørgsmål at diskutere.       Så vil jeg sige til hr. Køpke Christensen, at  spørgsmålet om sygehusbehandlingen har haft en høj prioritet  siden 1993, og hr. Køpke Christensen ved jo udmærket godt, at  nu sættes der rent faktisk de midler af, der er nødvendige,  for at de mennesker, der er syge, kan blive behandlet, når de  har behov for det, og for at de sindslidende kan få ikke bare  nogle ordentlige behandlingstilbud, men også sociale tilbud  og boligtilbud. Og nu gør vi frem for alt det - det har netop  været flaskehalsen, at der manglede personale - at vi sørger  for at uddanne det personale, der skal til for at forestå de  behandlinger, der er behov for i vores sygehusvæsen. De to  ting hænger sammen, og det ved hr. Køpke Christensen jo godt.       Jeg forstår, at hr. Køpke Christensen vil have, vi skal  gøre en hel masse ekstra for sygehusvæsenet; men til gengæld  er det for meget, at vi har ansat nogle flere i det  offentlige. Jamen der er jo hverken hoved eller hale i det.  Dér, hvor vi har fået flere offentligt ansatte, er lige  nøjagtig på serviceområderne, herunder sygehusvæsenet. Det er  meget bevidst, vi har gjort det, fordi det var nødlidende, og  fordi der var brug for noget mere personale på det område.       Så vil jeg sige til fru Jette Gottlieb, at jeg synes,  der er gode takter i den del af udspillet, der vedrører  arbejdsmarkedspolitikken. Det er takter, der alle sammen går  på at skabe fleksibilitet og skabe mobilitet i arbejdskraften  og blandt de ledige, så vi undgår flaskehalsproblemer  fremover og får forebygget, at vi løber ind i  flaskehalsproblemer på en lang række områder. Det er ikke  mindst de uddannede, der her er tale om, så jeg synes  faktisk, der er taget en lang række skridt, der vender  situationen til noget positivt, så vi får den fleksibilitet,  der er nødvendig for at forebygge flaskehalsproblemer.",

         "Først vil jeg sige til hr. Nødgaard vedrørende indfødsret, at  hr. Nødgaard ved jo bedre end nogen gennem sit aktive virke i  Folketingets Indfødsretsudvalg - og er der et sted, hr.  Nødgaard virkelig virker, så er det jo i hvert fald dér - at  når folk har begået kriminalitet og er dømt for kriminalitet,  er der ganske bestemte regler for, hvilken karensperiode det  i virkeligheden giver i forhold til deres statsborgerskab, en  meget lang karensperiode, hvis man har begået grov  kriminalitet. Så jeg tror, at de regler fungerer ganske  udmærket.  Så vil jeg sige til hr. Jes Lunde, at staten kradser  ikke penge ind ved ordningen omkring ATP. Det er en  pensionsopsparing, der er tale om. Det er en ekstra procent,  der indbetales i pension. Det er penge, man fuldt ud får  igen. Hvis man er i et lavtlønsområde, har lav indkomst, ja,  så får man oven i købet flere penge ind, end man har  indbetalt. Sådan er det socialt godt skruet sammen.  Så til spørgsmålet om ultimatum. Det er jo ikke et  ultimatum. Men SF, Venstre, De Konservative og andre partier  her i Folketinget skylder - det kommer vi til senere i dag -  at fortælle, hvad man forestiller sig. Man er jo skeptisk  over for det her med ATP. Men hvad vil man lægge frem? Lad os  se indholdet og et indhold, der lever op til at give den  samme sikkerhed for overskud på betalingsbalancen, som giver  den samme sociale profil, og som i det hele taget ikke er  mere bureaukratisk heller end det udspil, regeringen er  kommet med. Jeg vil gerne se, hvordan det er skruet sammen.  Så lad os vente med den videre debat, til vi har hørt de bud,  man har at give på det.  Kosova, opholdstilladelser - jeg vil henvise hr. Tom  Behnke til, at jeg forstår, indenrigsministeren skal i samråd  om det spørgsmål allerede her i frokostpausen i dag. Jeg  beder om, at hr. Tom Behnke har tålmodighed så længe. Det  varer ca. 1 time og 10 minutter.  Så vil jeg blot sige til hr. Albrechtsen, at det er jo  helt åbenlyst, og sådan har det altid været, at hr.  Albrechtsen og jeg har en meget forskellig opfattelse af,  hvad der er faktiske forhold, og hvad der er myter.",

Langkilde skal jeg såmænd blot kort sige, at enhver,  der har fulgt med i debatterne og specielt i afstemningerne  om miljøspørgsmål her i Folketinget, i alle tilfælde vil  kunne registrere - og det kan der føres en fyldig statistik  over - at Venstre og Det Konservative Folkeparti konsekvent  stemmer imod, hver gang der bliver taget skridt til  forbedring af miljøet, til at begrænse forureningen. Det har  vi diskuteret hundredvis af gange.       Så vil jeg sige til hr. Dahlgaard, at det jo ikke er nok  at kunne læse. Det er vigtigt at kunne læse; det er også  vigtigt at kunne sætte det, man læser, ind i en større  sammenhæng. Det, hr. Dahlgaard siger, er, at der  tilsyneladende skulle være en modsætning mellem det at lære  at læse og skrive, lære matematik og så også at få personlig  og social udvikling, for sådan må jeg forstå hr. Dahlgaard,  at det er et enten-eller.       Jeg siger altid både-og, men hr. Dahlgaard siger altid,  at det er et enten-eller. Hvis man sætter det op som et  modsætningsforhold, vil jeg sige, at så er hr. Dahlgaard selv  et skræmmende eksempel på, hvordan terpe- og sorteringsskolen  havde sine mangler i den tid, vi gik i skole. Man er nødt til  at forstå, at de to ting hænger nøje sammen: både læse,  forstå, skrive, kunne regne og så samtidig kunne udvikle sig  til nogle hele, fornuftige mennesker, der kan fungere i vort  samfund.       Så vil jeg sige til hr. Arne Melchior, at vi vil meget  gerne forhandle. Der var bestemt ikke noget fornærmende i  noget af det, jeg sagde. Der var ingen spydighed i det, jeg  sagde, men vi hører hele tiden det med at forhandle. Det, vi  er spændt på i dag, er også, hvad CD vil byde på; det er:  Hvad lægger man i det? Altså én ting er formen at forhandle  på, noget andet er: Hvad er det, man vil forhandle om? Hvad  vil man lægge på bordet? Det glæder vi os til at høre om fra  hr. Per Stig Møller, fra hr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, fra hr.  Holger K. Nielsen og fra hr. Melchior i dagens løb. Det er  dér, jeg siger: Det er ikke nok at sige, at man vil  forhandle.

Der var ingen spydighed i det, jeg  sagde, men vi hører hele tiden det med at forhandle. Det, vi  er spændt på i dag, er også, hvad CD vil byde på; det er:  Hvad lægger man i det? Altså én ting er formen at forhandle  på, noget andet er: Hvad er det, man vil forhandle om? Hvad  vil man lægge på bordet? Det glæder vi os til at høre om fra  hr. Per Stig Møller, fra hr. Anders Fogh Rasmussen, fra hr.  Holger K. Nielsen og fra hr. Melchior i dagens løb. Det er  dér, jeg siger: Det er ikke nok at sige, at man vil  forhandle. Vi vil også vide, hvad det er, man byder sig til  at ville forhandle om.\n"
